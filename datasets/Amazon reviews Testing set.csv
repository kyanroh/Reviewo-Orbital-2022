Reviews
This product so far has not disappointed. My children love to use it and I like the ability to monitor control what content they see with ease.
great for beginner or experienced person. Bought as a gift and she loves it
"Inexpensive tablet for him to use and learn on, step up from the NABI. He was thrilled with it, learn how to Skype on it already..."
I've had my Fire HD 8 two weeks now and I love it. This tablet is a great value.We are Prime Members and that is where this tablet SHINES. I love being able to easily access all of the Prime content as well as movies you can download and watch laterThis has a 1280/800 screen which has some really nice look to it its nice and crisp and very bright infact it is brighter then the ipad pro costing $900 base model. The build on this fire is INSANELY AWESOME running at only 7.7mm thick and the smooth glossy feel on the back it is really amazing to hold its like the futuristic tab in ur hands.
"I bought this for my grand daughter when she comes over to visit. I set it up with her as the user, entered her age and name and now Amazon makes sure that she only accesses sites and content that are appropriate to her age. Simple to do and she loves the capabilities. I also bought and installed a 64gig SD card which gives this little tablet plenty of storage. For the price I think this tablet is best one out there. You can spend hundreds of dollars more for additional speed and capacity but when it comes to the basics this tablets does everything that most people will ever need at a fraction of the cost."
This amazon fire 8 inch tablet is the perfect size. I purchased it for my husband so that he has a bigger screen than just his phone. He had gotten me one a few years ago so I knew it would be a good purchase.
"Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase."
"I gave this as a Christmas gift to my inlaws, husband and uncle. They loved it and how easy they are to use with fantastic features!"
"Great as a device to read books. I like that it links with my borrowed library e-books. Switched from another popular tablet brand and I am happy with the choice I made. It took some time to get books from my previous non-Kindle reader, but finally figured out a way!"
I love ordering books and reading them with the reader.
Not easy for elderly users cease of ads that pop up.
"Excellent product. Easy to use, large screen makes watching movies and reading easier."
Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
Simply does everything I need. Thank youAnd silk works wonders
Got it as a present and love the size of the screen
"The kindle is easiest to use, graphics and screen crisp, clear, brilliant colors."
nice reader. almost perfect for what i want/need. good bargain
I really like this tablet. I would have given 5 stars but sometimes you have to push start several times after you unlock the screen and it is a little annoying.
Great video quality lots of fun apps fun for the whole family
Love love love my kindle fire 8.....this is what my 9 yr old granddaughter said when I bought this for her at Christmas..we have purchased kindled in the past but this one has been the best....love the fact that you can now use a memory card in it...that helps so much when you use it for books...games...music and viedos...thanks
"Excellent tablet with nice screen. I wish Amazon would pre install the play store, this would have been perfect."
"Preloaded with the reading app from Kindle but expandable with other apps. Perfect for travel. Carry your library, games and productivity apps in a small footprint."
"Very happy with this product and easy to use..picture is clear, takes great pictures.."
"My grandchildren are home schooled and utilize the tables for many learning apps! They LOVE using them as it makes them feel ""so grown up""! The tablets are a great leaning tool and they are receiving many benefits from them!"
"Great size, easy to carry for traveling. Need to spend more time Looking into apps for contact manegement, interactive calenders and most important, music storage and use."
I purchased this when my last tablet died. It meets all basic needs and the price was great.
"Perfect for downloading and reading books !! Perfect size and has a nice, bright screen."
I was surprised when I learned of the capabilities of this device. Now my husband has more access to his desktop and I am doing things which I couldn't on his device.
I got it for my son. Its user friendly and durable.
"The visual quality on the Fire 8 HD is amazing. It runs very fast and is easy to use, very durable."
If your looking for a affordable gift this is it!.
"This is a great tablet for the price, would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic tablet."
Works great. Love the portability of books. Overall great product
I am still learning all the things I can do with my new Kindle Fire. It is so much better (lighter in weight and easier to use) than my old tablet.
Just the right size for reading books and playing some games.
I love everything about this tablet! The imaging is sharp and clear. It's fast and light weight. Love it!
Overall a nice product for traveling purposes Value for money
"My children love this table great quality of pictures, excellent camera"
I bought 3 tablets and my family was not disappointed.
Great tablet fast screen good size never gives me problem
"Bought this for my 87 year old grandmother who wanted to be able to play games and read books from the library. My aunt lives with her and can help her use it so its perfect for that type of user. After playing with It, I would consider it for just about anyone other than a hardcore user that wants the latest and greatest tech. if you are tech saavy, you can do more with these Fire tablets than advertised."
This is exactly what the person wanted as a gift and she enjoys using it.
Does all basic functions of a tablet. Hardcore users may want an iPad.
Works great for a simple tablet. Not a huge fan of the silk browser but it could be worse! I am very happy with my purchase!
It's fast and easy to use. This is my second kindle fire .
More flexibility than a Kindle and bigger screen. Like it because I can surf the web and download and read books.
"For the money you cannot beat this tablet. Full of features, picture quality is great, and very fast speed while using the internet."
"Easy to use, solid build, sharp HP screen for movies. Who needs more?"
Tablet is perfect for beginners who just want basic
"this is my first tablet .. love it .. actually read my first e-book on it .. large screen, easy to read & play games .. fits nicely in my purse"
This 8 inch Fire is definitely better than the cheaper 7 inch. It works fine enough for teens to play games and watch movies.
"Great tablet for under $100. Does not have the highest specs, but gets the job done for lite tablet users."
"I purchased the kindle fire because I needed a entertainment only device for long flights. This device is the perfect size for travel and easy to use and set up with your Amazon account. It is worth purchasing a Fire tablet if you are an Amazon Prime member. If not, I would not recommend it because the available apps are limited . My only complaint about this device is that if it freezes it is difficult to reset."
This fire tablet has long battery life. Reasonable fast
Got this for my wife and she loves it. She had the previous generation and this one is a giant keep forward.
Sleek packaging easy set up and great for anyone who wants a e reader with more to offer.
Best and most affordable option of all the Kindle devices available.
"I did not want to get a new kindle but my old one would not charge or show a charge anymore. I could not depend on it for any length of time so I finally broke down and bought a new one. I am very happy with this one. I was afraid I would lose my music and photos since not all came from the Amazon store. However, everything I had on the old kindle transferred to the new one. I am still learning all about it but so far so good."
My daughter likes this tablet to play her online games!
Easy to figure out and used it extensively on my vacation.
"Excellent tablet to leave at my easel and display reference photos. It's light enough to velcro to a articulating stand (so I can position the tablet right next to my canvas). It's cheap enough to not worry about. I love it, for the price."
I bought this wanting for books comics and movies and it has not disappoint ever since
My 4 year old Grandson loves his Kindle. He had to have one after his sister got one.
Easy to use. As a beginner I found this pad very good. Enjoy the kindle app.
This Kindle does what I need it to do. The camera could be better but overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.
Purchased this for my daughter to do more reading. It has so much more options for her if she wants.
"this is a great tablet for the price. my kid loves it ,does alot reading on it."
I was really hoping that this would be faster than some other inexspensive tablets I've had. I mainly use it for email though and it does the job.
Bought as a Christmas gift for someone. I bought iPad as well. Will update when it's used.
Great tablet for the price. It is easy to navigate.
I believe that this will be very useful during my husbands recovery from foot surgery.
This is something that is useful if your looking for something to take along trips
This is a wonderful device. I love the extra capabilities and apps.
Decent tablet. Access to kindle and pretty much all your google apps.
I am very happy with this tablet. The worst thing is that my steals it all the time. Lol
"A family member has vision problems. They had seen/used the Kindle of another family member - especially the ability to scale text. This device will make it possible to read, which she has had extreme difficulty doing."
Easy setup and connect to WIFI. Great viewing area. Easy to read in bright places.
I got this fire for my friend who wants to buy kindle..this serves both Kindle and Tab... very nice and very cheap..worth for what i paid.. I highly recommend this for beginners
Really enjoyed the price value of this tablet versus ipad
Amazing tablet with fast processor. It looks great... got good deal
We got this for our 5 year old and this is really great for the price. Works like a charm!!
"I find it easy to use, but the kindle does not come with instructions, so you have to find your way around."
"I bought this because I was tired of watching Youtube and Twitch on my phone. Excellent display sound is decent-not great but you can always buy a speaker. The negatives are-it is definitely a fingerprint magnet, and the Spectrum TV app is AWFUL-the app works fine on my phone, but for some reason on this tablet it freezes and is unusable. All things considered, for 65 bucks it's hard to be beat."
"I love this tablet. The battery life last a long time. I use my Amazon Kindle Fire predominately for watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix's, and checking my emails. I also carry it to my appointments and meetings. It is a compact tablet, and not big and bulky. The playback of the movies are great, and the movies are HD. Great little tablet if you are looking for something to watch movies and checking emails. I would definitely recommend this tablet to friends and family members."
"My daughter loves this kindle, she does so much with it,well worth the money."
Was looking for a tablet that was highly portable & could run my DIRECTTV app & stream videos. (Other electronics I have are much older versions). Salesman recommended this model to me based on personal experience. I am still learning all its functions but so far it seems easy to use & is doing what it promised to do.
"This is my second Fire, the other one is now retired. I like having HD. Works just fine."
My wife bought this for me for my birthday. I enjoy reading biographys which usually have color photos. The regular Kindle make the pics black and white or they're aren't any. This allows me to see the color photos. I also love the night feature when I'm in bed reading. I no longer need a light on to read or need to hold a large book.
"Thanks to a knowledgeable, low-pressure salesperson, I was ready to buy my first tablet. This one was the right price (on sale) and I have not been disappointed. Every few days I learn more ways to use it besides checking e-mails & checking out library books & audio books. It stays charged for days, even with regular use. I recommend it as an inexpensive and very satisfactory alternative to more expensive tablets."
"It's a great tablet for the price. Don't expect it to be as fast more expensive ones. It's meant for casual use and it does a great job at that. For the price, you can't beat it. Get a nice large microsd card and you don't have to worry about space. It runs a little slow on certain things if you are multitasking but it's a simple tablet. I've run plenty of 720p videos without fail. It's great for ebooks or other files. Some more elaborate pdfs take a while to load if they have a lol of graphics. Battery life seems good for a small table too.The only real Issue I have is the Amazon App store being limited. It is an offshoot of Android but not all the same apps are available. There is a way around it but I wish they would just allow it access to Google Play or at least offer the same apps.So, it's a nice inexpensive table that works great. For the money, you will love it but don't get upset that is doesn't run as fast as a $500 tablet. That's not its job."
Bought it for my 10 yr old granddaughter. Does everything she wants it to do in a tablet.
Very easy to use tablet. Lots of apps and game available.
"We love the FreeTime settings for kids on the newer Kindle Fires. I was able to create a login for each of our kids as well as myself and set limits to the amount of device time they are allowed daily (can set to more for weekends if desired). You can set the age restrictions for content also, to avoid inappropriate ads, etc. Once you've downloaded apps, you can choose which ones you want each child to have access to in their profile settings, so if one child is older you can allow them access to something their younger siblings shouldn't have. Basically, I like that I can set their access rights and know they're safe so I don't have to continually monitor every moment. By the way, FreeTime kids settings are available without having to subscribe to their FreeTime app access plan. :)"
"Great tablet, very clear picture. Would buy again."
Good reader which is why I bought it. Ads are annoying.
"It's a mini computer packed in a handheld devise. Applications load quickly and I am able to get my work completed, while riding the commuter rail."
Nice for a smaller tablet. It's good for Internet surfing.
"Purchased as a door prize gift given with a one year Amazon membership. The recipient loves it and says it performs very well. (As a past Amazon Fire user, now i-Pad graduate, I loved my Amazon Fire for more than 4 years without any problems. In fact, I just recycled it on to my son and it runs like a champ)."
"I have 4 other kinds of tables. This the best I have had. I can listen to music, read a book, listen to a book, or watch movies/tv shows."
Great product for the kids gaming apps parental controls to make sure you can monitor kids and prevent unwanted app purchases
I purchased 2 of these tablets for my 6 and 8 year old. They were a Black Friday special for $59. They are perfect for the apps and games they wanted.
Great product. Love the Amazon ecosystem. The Freetime subscription is a must
"Needed something a bit larger than the 6+ to stream Netflix, this was perfect!"
"my husband bought this for me as a Christmas present. I couldn't understand why he bought it because I already have a Kindle Fire.Once I opened it and got it going, I loved all it could do plus the graphic is so much colorful than my older Kindle."
my grandson-8-loves this --the games and the books!
Great product and I'm very satisfied with it. I recommend it to other people.
I purchased this tablet for my niece for Christmas and she love it.
"Easy to use, responds quickly, great screen brightness."
Great tablet but apps limited comparison of other tablets.
Works as we thought it should. NO PROBLEMS. Good buying experience.
"We have the smaller one, and been great. This one is even better, because of the size."
"I am a prime member & I love this tablet. Very user friendly especially if you are a prime member with amazon. Not real tech savvy so I need all the help I can get to keep things simple & automatic. Great clarity of picture/data. Have a 10"" tablet and wasn't sure about downgrading size (old eyes) but was delighted to see it works fine at 8"" instead of 10"". Also, easier to take around in the smaller size. Highly recommend especially if you subscribe to Amazon and are a prime member. Great benefits!!"
Got this for my wife. She loves the bigger screen and the better app management features that this one has over her earlier generation kindle. Definitely worth it!
"Connects to home WiFi automatically. Many books, and many games. Actually functions like a computer tablet. E-mail is a breeze."
"Bought this to replace no-name budget tablet for my daughter. She loves this as it is much faster and has a better display than her old tablet. This is a wonderful value as it is faster, has a better display and sound, is a name brand and cost about the same ... what's not to love about this product?"
"She loves this tablet. It works well unlike her ""bargain"" tablet which she tried to use previously and cost about the same. She likes the sound of it also! She enjoys the free games she downloaded and navigates the wev easily with it."
"It's no iPad, but it's great for Netflix and some app games. I'm not worried about the kids getting their paws on it since it's relatively inexpensive."
Didn't have some of the features I was looking for. Returned it the next day. May be good for others
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. It's speedy when loading books!
Purchased for my wife who reads a lot and truly enjoys the amazon fire.
"A great Christmas gift, the kids love the gifts..."
"Daughter got this as a present. It was easy to set up and display is great. Features allow us to limit her time on games, web, etc. while allowing her unlimited time to read"
I have enjoyed just learning how to use it. You're never too old to learn new things.
bought for husband and he was surprised it does the work he needs it for
This was a birthday present and it was ideal for a traveler to read ebooks on while on the rood
"My teenage daughter enjoyed her three year old 7"" Kindle for recreation but wanted a larger screen for word processing. Paired this with a Bluetooth keyboard and she was thrilled."
"i Bought this around black friday for $60 hoping it would be awesome... it failed so hard i tried multiple different micro SD cards none of which were recognized and YES i formated them with every format i could think of ... Fat32, NTFS, Fat, Xfat... i even tried to have the tablet do it... didnt work... to make matters worse half the apps i wanted to use werent in the app store and i came to find out that it isnt linked to the normal google play store this tablet has its own app store which is missing many common apps... the main reason i bought this was to play clash of clans and i cant because it wasnt on the app store... i tried to also use aftermarket play stores to play COC but it didnt work... launched and played 1 time but didnt work or update after that... needless to say i returned it and bought a $250 samsung galaxy tab A 10.1 (2016 version) with S-pen and its WAYYYYY better... bottom line you get what you pay for... also hint the s-pen version has an extra 1 GB of ram over the non pen version... so you should get that if you can afford the extra $50..."
The People I purchased this for during Christmas Holiday LOVED IT...
"I purchased two of these for my kids, ages 12 and 10. Forget the IPod touch. For the price, this tablet can't be beat! They can download games, books and movies for free all included with my Amazon Prime membership. Awesome!!"
my kids enjoy the Fire HD and they love the picture quality
Bought two of these tablets for my nieces for Christmas after we had originally bought the Amazon fire 7 inch which had a virus after 3 days of purchase and was unable to work good thing we played with it prior to giving as gift do to this being said I was very surprised on how well this tablet has held up to to not so careful 8 years olds playing with it daily we have had no problems screen is big enough for little hands to maneuver and see on was the highlight of there Christmas and still is would definitely recommend it
Really like the updates this product has in comparison to my first one
Functionality and ease of use are outstanding right out of the the box. Super clear screen and weight is minimum and is a joy to use.
This tablet is great for kids and adults who have little to no knowledge of computers. It handles easily and has plenty of storage
My god sister has been using these for years.What to read more!
"The latest Amazon 8"" HD tablet is a very good tablet for the price. The updated processor and extra memory (with expansion slot) allow for very good performance on all that we use this tablet for. Netflix, Hulu, browsing the internet, and doing e-mails all work very smoothly. Would recommend to anyone looking for a very cost effective tablet"
"totally worth the money, has all the apps I use on a daily basis!"
Good tablet. Wife loves it and would recommend....
I use mine mainly for its bigger screen. I do all the same things i do on my phone..but love the big screen. I bought one for eaxh of my nieces too. And they both love theres. Making videos..playing music..reading books. They bith love them! Im happy i got them for all of us. And always reccomend them to my friends for their kids too.
"Amazon Fire HD8 is a great product for the price. I picked it up for $69 during the holiday shopping season. Replacing a 1st gen Samsung Tab 2. This thing is sooo much faster. Perfect size for reading Kindle books , emails, and doing the social media thing."
It was a good gift for the price and had many features and options
"Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price"
"My kids can play, read, watch movies and much more love it!!!"
"Great tablet for reading books, but the bluetooth is hard to get working and there are much better tablets for games and movies"
I love this Kindle!! I am biased I think however I have had 3 previous ones I prefer Kindles to any other tablet
This is a great tablet for kids. I love that their time on the tablet can be restricted.
Easy to use. Good size. Great eReader. Not so expensive that I worry about my kids using it.
This Tablet was purchased for our Grandmother so she could play games and read books on.
"Bought a few of these for Christmas gifts .Everyone is happy !Its a great device for the $$. Low price, and great quality as always from FIRE devices."
"I purchased this item for my husband and he has liked reading Kindle books on it and the other features like Silk, etc. Light little tablet with good features."
"Bought this for our year end holiday party raffle prize pool. Great price and people always have a use for an amazon tablet. Came with Kaspersky for free as well, which is a pretty generous complimentary add on."
"My 6 yr old daughter got this tablet from Santa for Christmas. So far she loves it, a little too much perhaps.. I only use it to manage her account/permissions and so far haven't had any issues with it.. Software and HW not quite as refined as apple iPad products, but what can you expect at the lower price point."
"my opinion its a good option for the cost. Not as great as Apple Ipad, but it costs so much less. Still can get good use"
"Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it"
"the hd feature is what sold me on this product, along with the fact its a lotmore streamline than the older version that I have"
"Very nice for light internet browsing, keeping on top of email, viewing videos, and reading e books, which I like to get free from the library. Good browser, good battery power, fast charge. Very relaxing to sit in a comfy chair and read or browse. Has given me hours of enjoyment and information for a minimal price."
I bought this for my wife to replace her old Kindle and she loves it. Much easier to read than an iPad and updated features make it a great purchase.
Great tablet and price. Ordering online easy. Not happy took so long to receive though.
"Best tablet, good price, nice looking. Ordering on line was easy."
"I got this for my mom for Christmas. Every time I visit, she shows me something else she can do with it. I'm so jealous, I hope I get one."
This is my fourth Kindle...upgrading each time. Mine goes everywhere with me and is used throughout the day. Wouldn't be without it.
We bought this for our son when he went to college. He is able to upload all of his books and other documents.
I purchased it for my mother-in-law and she loves it it was easier for her to use and understand
The Amazon Fire is amazing! Picture clarity and sound are excellent! I highly recommend this tablet! Love it!
Sharp picture and easy to use. And a fantastic price
I like this is great I bought it my friend he was pleased abount
I wanted a low cost but quality tablet and this one is a dream! Easy to navigate and excellent graphics.
This a great tablet for everyone. Plenty of memory for downloading. Great features all around.
"I own two Nook tablets, another Kindle and a Samsung and this is the best one yet. Excellent battery life. Lets me check emails the Web and with Kindle. books can be switched from reads to listens. Also works better than the Nook with audiobooks."
I bought this tablet for my 4 year old daughter. Too many advertisements. I would rather pay more and not have a single ad.
This is a step up from what my son was using. He said it does well and easy to use.
This is a good tablet for kids who are starting off
I bought this for my 6 year old and it's perfect. Faster & clearer than older versions.
Awesome good size large enough for games and photos
Great gift easy to use and she loves being able to take it anywhere
"I bought this to replace the 7 inch version I lost in the airport. I wanted the bigger screen and the higher resolutions. It is much when loading games in offline mode as well as videos I have downloaded from Amazon Prime to play on the plane when wifi is not available. That was a plus for me. And now that the updated Netflix app allows the same thing, I have plenty of videos. I can also play my .mp4 videos using VLC player that I load to a microSD card. Of course you have wifi and Bluetooth so great for surfing try he net or listening to music. The 8 in screen is perfect for lying in bed and watching my show. I highly recommend this."
"Intuitive user interface, rapid online access through well designed features, light weight, ergonomic buttons for volume and power. Overall a thoroughly well designed, excellent priced device for web browsing and social media."
PURCHASED THIS WITH A STORE CREDIT AND LIKE IT A LOT. COMPARES WELL WITH MORE EXPENSIVE TABLETS..RECOMMENDED
"great device for the price. good looking screen, quick and efficient. amazon app store isn't that bad either"
Great gift for any age. Wish I bought two. I can do everything on this that I was doing on my ipad
Great budget tablet for web browsing. Also useful as an MP3 player and ebook reader.
I got 2 of these for my 8 yr old twins. My 11 yr old has one but this one is better. Perfect way to get them to read
This is a superb tablet for the price. It doesn't come with the Android operating system. It has Amazon's operating system. The battery last a good long time and apps run very fast. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a tablet.
"My daughter love her new tablet, I use for a few days and it's pretty good"
So very happy with the new kindle ! I highly recommend this product !
It may be cheap but this is a great tablet and works awesome.
My wife absolutely loves this tablet. It wad an early Christmas present
Bought for my 11 year old son and he absolutely loves it.
I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son. Very easy to use.
This product is very handy on the go. I can check emails and find work for my truck.
"I am an Amazon Fan. Ive only had Amazon tablets so I cant compare them with any other brand. But, Amazon has great customer service, a lot of great apps. The HD 8 is a great tablet for watching movies, most games, and social media. Its not as good as the Kindle fire hdx. The speakers arent as good, the hdx has more of a surround sound, but the hd 8 is less expensive, has a place for a sims card for extra space, and has an ok front and rear facing camera. Overall its a great tablet for a great price."
"I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube."
"Got this tablet for Black Friday. Wow, 16 gigs, great screen, expandable memory, what a deal. Tablet is a must have for Amazon Prime members. It unlocks the door for all those great Prime perks; books, shows, and shopping. Pairs to Alexa. Great screen for books! Buy it already!"
Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
overall this is a good tablet. it is best with those who have Prime Amazon and the ability to watch Amazon video. a good price for a good tablet but has limitations based on the operating system. for video watching and basic use a good choice
I love the size and portability of this. Keeps me in touch and having fun.
Nice tablet and couldn't beat the Black Friday price
I'm sorry I didn't buy it sooner! Very easy to use. Love it.
"It feels a bit more rugged than my original Fire tablet, and I believe it is an excellent value."
Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!
Bought as a gift for my 86 yr old mom to stalk her kids and grandkids on FB. She mastered it in a few.minutes with minimal instruction. Now I have to watch my posts.
For a cheaper price this does more than my kindle- love having this tablet
Had a smaller version. Love the bigger screen. Use this product more than a computer.
I bought 2 of the kindles for my grandsons. They love them! Had them charged and set up right away. No issues at this point.
"Easy to use bought for our 5 year old, found a case which allows him to keep it safe."
Great 8 inches tablet with and amazing storage for apps.
Santa dropped this off for our 4th grader along with expanded memory. he uses it for Netflix and Youtube as well as Minecraft and other Apps. Why spend hundreds on something for basic kids needs? I'm sure this will last him a few years and is well worth the price.
Got this tablet for my 3 year old son and he can not put it down. It is so much to do. So many learning games. I love this product
"This tablet runs smooth with all amazon apps, the internet runs at a steady frame rate and it had a decent sized screen."
This is a good device for entertainment and entry level tasks. I think it can do a lot for the price.
Nice price for the new model with Alexa built in and expandable storage!
"I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did."
this product is really awesome for kids to play in all sorts.We can use a strong case and let kids play in it .
i like the features it has and it is easy to navigate.
This is perfect my kids to do their school work on and have fun as well.
Great gift for my dad. Clear picture and easy set up
Love my kindle! Works better than expected! Kindle is much faster than my old tablet!
"I have never owned a tablet. Wanted an I-Pad like most, but couldn't afford the sticker price. This one fit my needs perfect. I mainly just use it for web surfing and streaming video. No complaints so far! I would recommend this device."
also great for listening to music and also for movies
The screen picture is crisp and bright. I will use this tablet for many things.
small and powerful... great adult toy for a reader
"This was purchased as a Christmas present for my aunt who lives with us. For the price, I thought it would be a good option for her since she doesn't want to drop the cash on an iPad.For comparison, the closest thing I have is an 8"" insignia tablet with similar screen resolution, storage, and features that was released at the same time. The Fire tablet impresses me! It is more responsive than the existing android tablet I have.This tablet runs FireOS which is Amazon's customized version of Android. Typically I do not like custom Android, preferring to have as close to a vanilla system as possible. I am not bothered by that with the Fire. If you need them the parental controls are second to none! The Amazon app store is extensive, although not as extensive as the Google Play store. Still you should be able to find pretty much everything you need there.This is not a flagship device, but performs incredibly for the price. I will most likely be purchasing one soon for myself."
I was hoping to use Google launcher with this tablet but it is really locked down and you cannot change the launcher or the lock screen. Still cheap and fine for watching movies.
"Great tablet for reading and also surfacing the web, along with your favorite social media apps!"
"The price is low because Amazon uses their adds to subsidize the price. The actual tablet works well. The biggest negative is that you can only install apps from the Amazon store. There are many Android Apps available in the google store that are not available in the Amazon store.I primarily use the tablet for bible gateway, dish anywhere, play some games, read the newspaper, and Facebook. In the future I want to try to use it with my local library."
Screen is very clear and battery last a long time. Very good substitute if you can afford a iPad.
"The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price."
A Great value for the money you can save instead of a Ipad from Apple.
Fun and reliable. Good quality for the money. Easy to use.
"Great for reading - nice image, easy on the eyes and lightweight."
"Bought this for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas! She LOVES it!!! A great alternative to a pricey iPad Mini!!! She uses it for watching Netflix, YouTube and we use it for homeschool. We are very happy with our purchase!!!"
I got this tablet on sale for my wife and she loves it
So far so good with the kindle fire hd. still need to play with it to see how to maximize our use.
"We love Kindle Fire, we purchase it for an older couple and it's easy to work."
The Amazon Fire is a great tablet with awesome graphics. I use it mainly for surfing the web and have had no issues with it.
Purchased for my nephew for Christmas. Used it everyday. Very good product and screen size is perfect for him.
Great tablet for the price. My granddaughter loves how user friendly it is.
got this for my nieces aged 6-13 they loved it and so did their parents really keeps them occupied
This was a gift for mom. She enjoys that it's easy to use and has good picture and sound quality. The price was also great
"Was wanting a bigger screen, which it is, trying to get use to different applications, so far seems easy."
The Amazon fire is simply amazing I would not buy anything else.
Didn't want to go to the sites amazon wanted me to.
We bought this for our three daughters! Got a kid proof case and added free time for a low monthly fee and couldn't be happier! So much better than worrying about them breaking my phone or iPad!
"I love my Kindle. I won't be without one. I've even bought an extra one, just in case. I believe it's the best tablet on the market."
Bought one to replace the smaller (non HD) version. Lot faster and picture is noticeably better. Would recommend for anyone not wanting to spend the extra $50 or so on the big names.
"Could not have asked for a better tablet for the money. I wasn't looking for anything extreme. Just wanted it to look nice and do it's job for games and browsing. Well it does that and more. Gave it to our son for Christmas and now I want one myself. We are going to buy another for my mother in law. Lightweight, simple layout. Snappy. Can't go wrong."
It was a perfect gift for my godson. He loved it! Definitely would recommend this product.
I can do a lot of things on my Kindle I used to rely on the computer for.
Excellent resource for children video streaming by Wifi using mobile hotspot with kids.
"The kindle fire tablets are great for the price. They have solid performance in battery life and processing power. The only downside is that the Operating System is a different variation of Android, so there could be some incompatibilities."
best choice under 100$ in marketamazon is the best!!!
I really didnt expect how its going to work.but its very good.gifted to my friend
Bought this as a gift for my mom and this was to replace her original Kindle Fire. She's have had a month now and is loving and no problems with it.
This was a request from our 7 yr old granddaugter who had always asked her older sister if she could share hers due to we bought this same tablet/size a few yrs earlier. Loved the security/parental control options.Starfall a favorite educational app were told is a must have. Really enjoy Pics/Viber due to their in a different state. Also some games on a time limit. Size and resolution are perfect.
"This is the best device I have found for my e-books. I know it can be used for a lot more, but it is my library in my hand."
"I bought this tablet to be pretty much exclusively an e-reader. It's actually cheaper than most of the kindles. For that limited use, it works fine. I don't think I would want to use it as a general purpose table (too slow!). Makes a fine e-reader though. As for recommending this to a friend, I would, but would make sure they knew what I use it for."
"I bought this as a Christmas present for my sister and she LOVES it. It's easy to use, lightweight and doesn't seem to have a lot of bugs or glitches. It's a good source of entertainment for when she's at work but has down-time. She passes the time reading ebooks, browsing the web and playing games."
"I originally purchased a Kindle paperwhite but returned it the next day and purchased this one. Very easy to read on, watch movies, and listen to music."
Works well. Easy to use. Battery seems to be good. Would buy again.
Ticks all the boxes I was looking for at a price I was happy to pay. One caveat that I (or the Best Buy and Geek Squad crews) was unaware of: there is a glitch in the keyboard that prevents it from working properly. Kindle/Amazon are aware of the glitch and will download a third-party keyboard fix to replace the keyboard that's built in to the unit until they are able to fix the problem. I made Geek Squad aware of it and they should know about it now.
Amazon MayDay functionality is not available and this was unexpected. Other services and functionality as expected
Perfect tablet to take anywhere you go and lighter than my IPad.
Easy to use tablet for every day use. Additional apps can help increase productivity for work and daily use.
This tablet does all I need a tablet to do. Reason why it's my 3rd one.
"Bought this tablet for my fiancée daughter, after getting it home and set up, I decided to keep it for myself. Great screen and works great with my pair of Amazon echos. I love it and highly recommend it."
"This is my first Amazon e-reader-tablet and the second e-reader I have. It is easy to use once you get through the initial hoops. I like the free games and the fact that I new can load books from my computer to the tablet. And one thing, I am not in the market for a tablet but for a bigger e-reader. It is a lot better than the Nook that I have. I love this product"
Bought as a gift for parents who aren't tech savy but were able to use it with ease
"I have Bought several versions of this tablet for my kids over the years and have been ever impressed with it. I first got one for my son, the my oldest daughter to replace her children's tablet, which was worthless, this tablet gives you everything you could want and allows you to control what your kids access on it and even lets you see what they download onto it. if you want to set a time when it shuts off at night you can, when they can play games or use Netflixs you can...great product!"
Great gift for a younger person who wants a tablet
The fire is great. The size is really nice. Not to big. The clarity is really good.
This inexpensive tablet does everything I want it to do. I can read my books and magazines and keeps tabs on my kids and grandkids on Facebook. Very easy to use and crystal clear pictures and video.
"Great entry level tablet for kids or anyone that will not be heavily using a tablet. The 16 GB, is too small but can add an SD card. Beware only comes with 6GB of the 16 for your apps. Comes with bunch of preloaded Amazon apps."
This tablet is great. I loved the color and all the features it has. I will be buying more for my daughters. Great purchase
"What I expected. A better then budget tablet ata good price. Bought for the integration with Alexa and it works well, more info about your Alexa request will show up automatically on the tablet."
It's a excellent tablet for my kid she downloaded games and watch cartoons
I was looking for a Good tablet under $100..this delivered..getting used to Amazon apps LOL
Excellent ratio quality price. Lightweight. Good resolution and easy to use.
After long review decided to buy the Fire Tablet as a gift for a great frienday. She loves it! It's the perfect size and has all the features she was looking for in a tablet. Happy Birthday!
Love everything about my Kindle. I'm a long-term Amazon Prime member.
Great tablet for the price. My father in law likes the easy use of the tablet.
The Fire is an excellent table for many basic tasks.
Not a good product short battery life i can only use for 20 minutes
"I was looking for something to read on and this fit the bill for the right price.Great screen clarity, good adjustment too. Works well and the battery life is great. Size is nice too. Big enough for 1 hand if needed."
"This is a great tablet for books, games and web browsing. It is very user friendly, -and I would definitely recommend this product!"
I enjoy to use the reader and like the idea that I can go to the internet from the Kindle.
I thought that this tablet was junk but it has surpassed my expectations
"I wasn't really expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised.It feels solid, responsive, screen is good.For the price its a bargain!!"
Good if you want something inexpensive and Will do the minimum very well.
"I like this ipads for my baby and me too,special and super ok thanks byee"
I found it to be very versatile and enjoyable benefiting from a touch screen.
Ipad killer! A fierce tablet at a convinient price!
bought as a gift she loves it all kinds of apps easy to use and even easyer with amazon prime
I bought it as the display for my Echo. Turning on Voicecast routes information to the tablet with the voice reaponse. It'S been exactly what I hoped it would be and the price was right.
"This tablet is exactly what I was looking for to take on trips. The kids can watch their movies and videos, or I can read from my kindle library. Perfect size."
I bought this as a gift for my son and I know he will love it he has the old kindle fire as likes it a lot
"My mom had an old one, she was so excited to get this one."
Works great and is fast. Great for reading and internet use
"This Kindle is so overloaded with apps that I will never use. Despite what one of Best Buys' associates said, you cannot remove any of the Amazon apps. The apps take up too much of the memory. I have an I Pad and love but bought this as a backup for work. Unfortunately, it bogs down. I also don't like that Amazon wants access to too much info to set up email, so I won't use this for emails either. I will likely sell it on Craig's List for less than half of what I paid for it."
"Fine for reading, ...haven't used it for anything else yet"
"I have been using a Kindle Fire for a couple of years. It was a good tablet, until the screen went black. Best Buy replaced it and I couldn't have been more pleased. I enjoy reading on my Kindle Fire HD more than ever. Try it and you'll buy it!"
"A viable substitute for the more expensive I Pad especially for kids wanting a tablet. You can download books, games, email and access the internet. Parental controls are easily enabled."
blueray is just twhat I was I was looking for great for watching movies thank you
Love best buy and I shop at Best Buy I always buy my TV for me and my kids I buy my kids tablets at Best Buy Love Best Buy
"Got this for my mom for her birthday, and she absolutely loves it. Great tablet for the price point, good tablet overall."
I love all of them. I would recommend going to Best Buy and buying a kindle fire before they are sold out!
Nice size screen easy and light weight to take to class
This tablet is great for my son. Would be nice if it had a little more horsepower
"My 76 year old mom loves this! She now has something to do while waiting in doctors offices - loves to read, do crosswords, etc."
I enjoy it more then the I-pad that its replacing. Easy to read in any light and the size is perfect for travel.
"I absolutely love my kindle 8! Great picture, storage & sound. Can't live without my kindle!"
I liked it at first except the browser is kind of clunky. Also you can. It use all android Apps. The worst thing though was mine just stopped working in the middle of watching a movie on a long plane flight. It was fully charged. I have tried recharging and turning on etc. it is just a blank screen and off. Kind of a cool paperweight. Hope I can get my money back. Or get a new one.
Love my mine! Works great with prime! And I have all my best movies!
I bought this for my dad in his late 60s mainly to listen to music and read ebooks borrowed from the library. I set it up for him and he loves it. I just don't like that it has ads on the start up unless you pay to get rid of them.
Enjoy reading books on it as well as viewing videos.
Got two for my mom's and they love it. So many great features!!!
this tablet is awesome. the fact that I can use a micro sd card to have more memory and can listen to my content on the card is great. the additional screen size is what I wanted and it has not disappointed. this was a great purchase!!!
"I'm very happy with my Kindle Fire. Beyond being able to read books, it does all sorts of things and is able to download a huge variety of apps. It also holds a charge very long. The size is perfect and portable, yet the screen is much larger than a smartphone, which I love. I would definitely recommend this tablet to others!"
The Amazon Fire HD 8 is an awesome device. THE PRICE OF THIS TABLET IS MIND BOGGLING!! This tablet has everything you would expect and want in a tablet and more. It has Amazon Store and Amazon Prime preloaded. It's so much fun and so easy to use. THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS TABLET IS UNBELIEVABLE. You never stop thinking about the modest price you paid for such a fantastic tablet. It feels comfortable in your hands. The design is nice. The size is adequate for all tablet use. You can expand the memory storage of this device an additional 240GB. Can you believe it? Outstanding!!
Bought as a Christmas present. Son uses it to watch youtube and Netflick. Works great.
The overall design makes it fir very nice in the hand. It is very easy to setup and has features that I did not utilize on previous Fire tablets. I like the camera and the Blue Shade ability. I like to read before bed and the color really does help me wind down. Long lasting battery!
Got this Fire tablet for my youngest daughter for Christmas and she loves it. I also love the option to restrict apps and content for her age!
I bought two of these Amazon Fire HD tablets in December as Christmas gifts. Both recipients are happy with these as gifts. I plan to purchase one in the near future for myself.
"Biting as a gift, my only concern was the size and the Amazon interface. It was easy enough to download the Google play store, so it was familiar to the user. Size was an initial concern, but it was just right to watch movies without being so cumbersome."
My son really likes the larger screen to play games.
Very easy to use and has so much to offer for the low price.
"great product, easy to use, love the lighted pad, ease of down loading books,"
They were using them on Christmas morning!! It didn't take them long too be getting the best from those tablets
So I think I would have rated 5 stars however when I got my tablet home my 8 year old used it for a total of 2hrs...the next day it had a reboot screen similar to Dos windows. Excellent customer service at store allowed me to exchange next day. No problems with the second one. Great tablet for the price.
i love it amazon is nice read book on it play games on it
I bought this Kindle as a gift for my mother so she could access her Facebook account easily. She loves the ease of using it. I have 3 kindle tablets in my home and they are used daily. My mother uses hers for email and some light gaming and for watching Netflix as well. Very satisfied.
I wanted a low cost internet device to feed internet radio choices into my stereo. This fit the bill well. I use the headphone jack to connect with my stereo and get great sound. I don't use most of the other apps that come on the device.
"The Kindle Fire is a wonderful, small device to use for a multitude of tasks. We use it mostly as an ereader and has been so simple to use. So happy we chose this one. It is lightweight and convenient to take with you."
"I bought this as a temporary replacement for my wife's 11"" Kindle Fire HD that was out for service. She liked this 8"" model so much that she continued using it after the 11"" one returned."
"I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad"
"This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase."
Great for watching sports events away from home but within wi fi range.
So easy to download and then read. Enjoy reading that I can take anywhere without the heaviness of a book
"I bought this after subscribing to an Amazon Prime membership. This is a great little tablet at such a low price.. too good of a deal to pass up when it was on sale. It has the ability to talk to Alexa, surf the web, listen to music and read books/magazines (lots of free music and books for Prime members)."
"If ads dont bother you, then this may be a decent device. Purchased this for my kid and it was loaded down with so much spam, it kept loading it up making it slow and laggy. Plus the carrasoul loadout makes it hard to navigate for kids, not very kid friendly! Oh you can pay $15 to remove the ads but it wont remove them all. Buy the samsung, better everything!"
"This is my second Fire, I'm upgrading from the 2nd generation 7"" model. Love the screen resolution. Movies and videos are sharp and no pixelating. The camera is a bonus my first version did not have. All together this was a great buy for under $100 on sale. Thank you Best Buy."
"I would buy it again and have twice over already. I actually bought the kids fire kindle and bought this for my wife, her's was lost and she borrowed my sons kid fire kindle I ended up buying her this again, and would buy it again. I would recommend buying a sd card it fills up fast without out it but it is a lot cheaper to buy the lower GB kindle and then buy a good sd card."
"This tablet has it all. Amazon offers tons of free apps, hundreds of thousands of free e-books and tons of free games. The tablet is intuitive and intelligent. I seamlessly enjoy streaming my favorite shows and reading articles, books and periodicals. What I love most is that the tablet doesn't place all apps on the device, but uses the users miro SD card instead for up to 200GB of additional storage for a dizzying amount of storage for more games, apps, books and movies that can be downloaded and enjoyed. It also allows the owner to share the device with family members, delegating each member an account personalized and tailored to that individual. There is even an option to create children's accounts--extra bonus. I am able to mirror the content from the tablet onto my Samsung Smart television. I will definitely consider Amazon first and foremost when making any future tablet purchases. It maintains a charge for a good deal of time, alleviating the need to be near an outlet to enjoy using it. I can charge it in the evening and use it for several hours the next day, sometimes two days. No one will ever create a tablet that is more considerate of the owner/end-user."
I love to read and this tablet makes it so easy to carry an entire library with me everywhere. I have also become addicted to the free underground games.
"Bought this 8"" model to use in addition to my current 3 year old Kindle Fire HD (7 inch model). So far I am very pleased with the quality of this unit. The slightly larger screen makes watching movies much better. I didn't want the larger 10"" screen (yet)."
"I purchased this on Black Friday because I could pass on the price. The tablet works great for basic internet needs and great for shopping on Amazon. If I were to purchase another Android Tablet, I will look for something with a little more power since this tablet slows when multi-tasking."
"I bought this for my son (he's 1.5 years old) so he could play basic toddler games, but I found the tablet to be extremely useful for school with it's large screen and super long battery life. I'm waiting for the Surface Pro 5 but this tablet that I got for so cheap is making me second guess paying so much! For basic lecture taking notes and watching Netflix or Hulu and kid games, this can't be beat."
The best tablet for the price i use it everyday to watch youtube videos
Great purchase for my granddaughter for Christmas.
This tablet is perfect for just about anything you could want to do on a tablet.
My grandmother enjoys this tablet ... it use as her reader.
"Great item at great price, MY WIFE LOVES IT AND WONT PUT IT DOWN!"
great black friday deal for a mediocre tablet. android os though!
"Wanted a tablet at a cheap price and this item fit the bill. Bought on Black Friday which made the price even better. The screen looks good and the performance for the apps I have used so far have met expectations. I mainly used for surfing the web, youtube, and netflix. This device handles each with ease. Overall, I am satisfied with this device."
"Works well; no issues with reboots or system hangs.. Good size - not too big and not too small. Screen is good for reading. Battery life is good, I've bought a few books from Amazon but mostly side-loaded books from the library onto a 32 GB micro sd card."
"Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option"
"I got this for my son and he loves it! He can play games, watch movies, you tube videos, and use the internet for help with homework. He also loves all the books, and aps. Was a great black Friday deal should have gotten one for myself."
I got it at a great price. They price matched for me. Much faster then getting my laptop out to check email
I purchased this product for my youngest son! He loved the color and the size. The storage is great for the number of activities that he has downloaded!
Was looking for a tablet to run my remote music server with from my easy chair. My first tablet I bought at about the same price ran through the battery in an hour. Amazon product is much better for battery life and image quality is very nice.
This product is easy to use. Screen size is great. Would recommend to anyone.
I got it for my kid and she loves it. The amazon free time and prime well worth the money
"Best tablet around, cheaper than most and does just as much as other tablets. Great buy, it works perfect! Battery lasts a few days too."
She likes to read books and this is a fast and cheap way for her to do so
It's a great buy. Just to read emails and go on the web
Great Christmas gifts for the kids. Hours of fun and games.
I purchased this tablet mostly for entertainment. I enjoy playing games and this tablet is great for that purpose. Also plan on using it for reading electronic books.
Very nice quality product. East to set up and use.
So much more screen size than previously kindles. Fast charging. Longer battery life.
"Purchased for my mom to read ebooks, great performance, screen looks good, easy to use. Very happy with this purchase."
less expensive than last year with so many more features and bigger screen!
Bought for my wife for X-mas and she loves it. Hasn't put it down
"This is a good product for video, surfing and reading. However this version has dropped all android support as far as I can tell. I have a couple of apps that run on my old Fire just fine but are extremely problematic on this one. There is one app I use everyday but it doesn't work on this new Fire, so I have to keep the old one around. Kind of inconvenient. I would recommend seeing if your app is supported on this Fire before dropping the money."
This was a reasonable replacement for a broken tablet.
Purchased this tablet for my two year old son. It is easy for him to use and has been surprisingly durable. Would recommend the replacement plan if purchasing for a child.
"Better and faster than Kindle 7"". Great performance for the price."
"Love it, easy to operate. Very reasonable price - on sale."
Good product. Onboard storage does fill up quickly.
Bought as a gift to my dad and he likes it so far. It's fast enough for apps and great for reading
"Works great but the app store is nothing like that of Apple or Google. Fortunately, you can install many Android apps from 1Mobile. The screen is fabulous and it's great at its roots: making reading books fun."
"I love this tablet. I know it's not an iPad or any of the big tablets but it does just what I need it to do. I've had it a few weeks now. I've downloaded videos, read a few books and played some games. I've had zero problems so far. I know it's not the best video, but for the price of the tablet I don't expect it to look like my flat screen TV. I'm trying not to load too many things to keep it from slowing down. So far so good. Browsing the internet is easy too. I'm getting used to the browser and the app store for Amazon. For the price of this tablet it's not too shabby!!!"
You can do some many things and the best part apps for free on Amazon underground!
"Works great for my 6 year old. Wanted an inexpensive tablet for himsince he can be pretty rough with things. So far so good, and we love the FreeTime app."
Was looking to get an inexpensive tablet that ran Android. The Amazon Fire tablet was a much better value than other similar products. Have been very happy with the tablets durability and quality so far too. Would recommend to anyone looking for a lower-end tablet.
Bought 2 for each of our teenagers and they just love it... Very cool reading features and zero buffering while watching Netflix.
Good quality product. Clear display and easy to use.
"My mother, husband, and daughter all enjoy using Fire. It's a great way to stay preoccupied."
Out of all the tablet choices out there we buy these for our children over any other. You can't beat the price and durability.
very good product and right on the cost! Great gift for the holidays.
Purchased this for reading and the price. Good value for money.
"Great for reading, game playing, searching the web and social media."
"I really like the Fire IS 8 16gb, it is fast and smooth."
Does everything a regular tablet can and for the price you really can't beat it
This is so easy to use and does exactly what I hoped.
Great tablet for streaming ! good internet connection along with a nice display
Bought it as an e-reader. Convenient and easy to use. Text is very readable. I am pleased.
"This is a nice little tablet for the $60 I paid on black Friday. At the regular price I would probably have gone with something a little less restricted and without so much Amazon content. The lock screen ads aren't much of a problem, I understand Amazon sells these cheap and gets it back via ads, but the 15-20 Amazon apps are a little much. It would be easier to stomach if you could add the ones you want or remove the ones you don't. That said, I was able to install the Google Play store and this tablet does everything I need it to do. Overall, I'm pretty happy with the purchase. It's a nice new toy. One note: In the online photos the magenta looks purple. It's actually pink. If you like purple, get a black one and a purple case."
So cool after playing with this for a while now I would never spend the money on an apple for what I am doing with it.
Love the new fire hd 8. Price is amazing and if you are an amazon prime mbr its even better! Great for the kids as you can lock their profiles to a kids mode and they can't buy anything. If i had one downfall its the smaller amount of apps available than apple or google play.
"Had the Fire HD 7"" before and just wanted to upgrade. Loving it so far and really enjoying the bigger screen!"
The tablet is not for me it is for a Christmas gift
This was a great buy for my son. He needed something that he could easily transport and that woudl allow him to access the internet and various forms of media. This was a perfect choice since he also has a amazon Prime account.
"This was replacement for my wife's original iPad and broken Kindle Paperwhite. She loves it, as it does basically everything both of the previous devices did in one unit that is easy to use, has good battery life, very nice screen resolution and good size for her. Great value, especially compared to an iPad."
for the price this is a great works well the for the price display is hd love it
"for the money, you will be well pleased, I think it is a big bargain !"
"I purchased this tablet for my mother, but I set it up and tested it out. It is super fast! I have the original Kindle Fire and all I can say is Amazon has come a long way! The new Fire HD8 is so much better than the original! I like it so much that I am thinking of purchasing one for myself! I would highly recommend this tablet to anyone!"
"I have had a Kindle before, and needed a new one as the old one would no longer charge very well. Still adjusting to some different features from the original one. Do not like the fact that it is difficult to find a case for this one."
"Very happy with this purchase, it was exactly what I was looking for"
"My original Kindle Fire no longer accepted a charge. I wasn't going to replace it, because I bought an iPad. When I saw the HD8 in a kiosk in a BB store, I realized how much better I liked the size and feel of it for reading books (the iPad is preferred for other things). This Fire's clarity is much improved over my old one, plus it responds better. I don't like that I can't choose a photo for the locked screen - that it HAS to be an advertisement. I also don't like that it usually takes a few trys to unlock. Menial issues from my perspective."
"It's a good starter tablet, to bad it runs on the Amazon OS."
Got this for my sister as a Christmas present and she loved it.Easy to use and great for books.
"This is my third Kindle, I still have the other two; however, this has a camera and much larger screen. I would take this product any day over a tablet."
Look forward to hearing more from my grandkids so far they love it
"Good small tablet for all purposes for reading, playing games"
My wife and kids love easy to use and the size is perfect
Great tablet for beginners! Very light and screen is wide. Enjoy using for travels.
Fast processing great battery reads to me when my eyes bother me. Expandable memory a big plus.
The new kindle fire hd is good and my son loves it
Got this for my grandmother and she absolutely loves it.
She loves to use it to watch Netflix and play games
This is just the right size and can put games on it just like an iPad.
I wanted a new kindle fir a while. The price was right
"The display is not as sharp and vivid as they say but still good. Probably better for reading than watching videos. We didn't really get it for the games, but there is a good selection. WiFi works well and internet browsing is fast."
The Kindle is a great way to read and watch videos with ease!
Exciting tablet still amazed by the ease of use great product all in all
"Couldn't beat the value for this with the Black Friday price. They aren't the best tablets, but they do a lot for the price."
"great size,sound and battery. just buy it already."
Love the tablet mainly use for games and internet. Grrat product foe the price.
"She hasn't used the it yet, but my son did a quick check and it seems just fine."
"I've had my other Kindle Fire for 5-6 years. It's still working but slowing down. I bought the updated version while it was on sale. I love it! I play games on it, download books, check my email and facebook. It's like a portable mini computer and I wouldn't be without it. I like it better than other people's tablets and you can't beat the price. I bought some for gifts and everybody loves it! I'd recommend it to people of all ages."
"Great product, no complaints at all,good for kids and adults"
"At ninety dollars, the expectionations are low, but this is still a very good table, it's good for light use like watching videos or web browsing, but the camera is a bit lacking, and at certain times the device can freeze or lag. Overall this is a good tablet for $90, I would recommend this to anyone on a budget."
Good starter unit. Easy for a beginner to use. Priced low to give you a taste of the tablet world.
"The Parental Options need some work. You can't even log in to a child account until you have Apps loaded for them to use. Also a kid's login doesn't have access to pre-loaded apps (like the calculator). Seems really odd to me that you can't give them access to basic functionality of the tablet.Otherwise, the tablet itself works great."
"Bought a Fire HD 8 tablet for my wife. She doesn't like using computers and avoids smartphones, but her new tablet is a big hit. She uses it to play games and to stream movies and radio programs. I use it for everything else -- reading news, checking e-mail, online shopping, etc. It was very easy to set up and even easier to use. Plenty of speed and capacity to do everything we want."
We already own kindles so we know they are great ! My son is going to live this!
I purchased 2 of these FIre HD tablets as gifts. They pack a lot of punch for the price. I helped set them up so I was able to get an idea of how they are going to work. The screen was very nice and clear. Speed of tablet was good. It is easy to use. If you are already in the Amazon family through prime it is a no-brainer.I don't believe you can get a better tablet at this price point.
I bought these as a starter online browser. It is a very portable pad . Great price.
Just what my wife wanted and needed she loved it! It is easy to use and simple to set up!
Good tablet for the money. A good add on if you have Amazon prime
You can't beat the price. Great deal for what you're paying.
We bought it for our 9 yr. Old daughter and she loves it. We do as well. Kindle tablets are great!
"its fast, it has good lighting. its got the 16gb space, best gift ive bought for a bookreader."
I love it.....Reading E books here is so easyPerfect for price
"With a $20 off deal last blackfriday, who will not get it. Much clearer and faster than the other fire HD. Light weight too"
"If you shop on Amazon all the time, this will help make it easier still. Lots of ads pop up, and you can't use apps from non-Amazon sources unless you root it, and that is complicated. This is not a realistic alternative to an iPad or Galaxy Note. If you just want to a device to shop on Amazon with, you'll love it."
This is my 2nd Fire tablet. I will alwyas need one. Just wish they lasted longer than 4 years.
fire tablet is very powerful for the size and does everything!
"While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7"" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing."
Price was fabulous for an entry level tablet. Right on
Was impressed how quick and responsive touch and overall speed.Including Alex app.fit in top coat pocket
"I have been buying Kindles since they first came out. When ever I want to upgrade Kindle is my chosen brand. I am not very tech savvy and I enjoy watching movies, listening to music and primarily reading. I like the ability to purchase narration for my favorite titles and using text-to-speech for the rest."
Have not used these yet as they are Christmas gifts
Wife loves this thing. She reads nonstop on it. She can't put it down
Nice for the price had to put Google play store on myself but still a nice tablet
"This is a really good tablet for adults but especially great for kids as you can load movies or add apps that they can use. The cost is so low you just can't beat it. Plus, the main feature for me was the Amazon Kindle name on the product which puts it way ahead of the no name tablets on the market. Great product and gift."
I purchased two of these on Black Friday. What a great purchase. These are very inexpensive and have the ability to do so many things for the kids. I later bought tough cases to keep any damage minimal.
I love my kindle. I bought the larger screen after owning 2 previous 7 inch screens.
this tablet has the best battery ive ever seen. The picture is great too.
LIke that there are lots of apps to choose from. Very user friendly
"I wanted a new tablet and saw the 7"" on sale at Christmas, my husband was offered the 8"" for just $10 more, so good value ! Thin and light weight. Easy to start up. I would have liked to have a booklet on featuers and use, etc. Nothing in print came with it other than one paper . Tutorials on set up and where the buttons and slots were. I have enjoyed the quick loading to start, just wish I had a physical booklet on how to's, not just online tutorials."
More features In several ways than iPad. This android tablet is really powerful
"I bought this for my wife because she plays a lot of games along with my grandson, this is perfect to download all the games they want without taking up space on her iPad."
Great to take with me when I need alone time to just surf and read.
Love the tablet! Easy to use and easy to take with
Awesome tablet! Love using it to read and surf the web.
"It matters what preference you prefer with tablets. I mean if you use windows or google more this might not be for you. For me, I use Amazon music, video, books, and shopping so this tablet is awesome. It's made especially for Amazon ecosystem users. Its light and has a nice feel. I live the blue shade option it has for less blue light when reading."
Enjoy having the kindle. My son uses all the time for reading. It has helped him improve in his reading skills. We are glad we bought it. Thank you.
"This was one of the best birthday presents, I ever purchased for my husband. He said he doesn't use the computer, but he was on my smartphone daily viewing FB. I got him a drone for Christmas and he needed something to view, while it is flying. I researched the Kindle Fire and thought he could practice with it until spring. He farms, so isn't busy in the winter. Thank goodness, because he is busy with his Kindle for hours every day. He thinks it is great and I do too, because now I have my phone back."
"I really enjoy reading. So much so I was running out of shelf space. I have read a few books with my I-pad mini but it really didn't do the trick. No so with my new Amazon Fire Hd-8. Handy sized, not the least bit heavy and super bright. Add in the face that digital material from magazines to novels are often as not far cheaper that ""hard copies""."
Amazing video quality easy to maneuver wonderful screen size easy set up
Great tablet other than the photo image quality is fuzzy and not the best.
The Fire HD8 strikes an excellent balance between performance and price. It has many of the features you'd want in a tablet for a fraction of the cost. Works flawlessly for reading and video streaming.
"This is my second Kindle and I love it. It's lightweight, simple, and fast. It's convenient for trips and fits in my bag without weighing it down."
Bought this as a gift. My mother likes it. It's easy and simple to use.
I am loving my fire tablet and I am using it everyday at home and at work on break
I will be ordering Amazon fire for my two granddaughters because they love Nana's so much
Really beautiful display is great for watching movies and playing games. It is very powerful for the price and you can play lots of games from Amazon for free - they even remove microtransactions from lots of games.Only downside is you need Amazon Prime to get the most out of your tablet
"Very little set up, Amazon helpful in setting up the functions. Clear pictures and easy to use. Take pictures both ways"
Graphics are great for the price. Would highly recommend.
"Bought this for my mom and it was just what she needed and at a great price. Been wanting to get an Ipad for myself, but think this might be a great less expensive option for me as well."
The pad worked as I thought but the screen wasn't as vibrant as our iPads. Still a great deal for the price.
Perfect thing I needed to read books on and play my games
"I'm loving the tablet so far. I really like the Amazon underground, and the Fire OS just updated, so it has Alexa on it now. :)"
this tablet is perfect for surfing the internet and following social media
"I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories."
For its price. Amongst the others I felt this was a deal
Perfect size and very responsive. I have 4 of them.
"No issues runs games and internet well. ,,,,,,,,,,,,"
It is very easy to use for children . We have loved having one and are hoping to buy another one for kids Christmas !!
good price for the product. I purchased for my middle school son.
"not good, hate it , never buy it again, sucks. done"
"Smartphone works on the job for me, but with the Fire I can read instructions and worksheets. It is a useful tool for connecting with both friends and colleagues. 8-inches is the right size for holding in hand and carrying with you. Gives me the information, beats printing everything out, or carrying around a large laptop."
Think this will be a great product for my parents it is a Christmas gift.
"The Amazon fire tablet is an excellent product. I primarily use it to purchase and read books from Kindle. Also, I use it for my Facebook activity. The battery life is long and it recharges quickly. My 10 year old son also enjoys using it. I would highly recommend this product to others."
"My husband is a truck driver and being on the road away from home, he likes to have shows and movies to watch. This has so much space for him to download things to watch."
"A great Kindle reader. Easy to order, read and store books. Also speedy for finding Amazon products and ordering them. But the other apps are really slow - too slow."
Easy to use as a tablet and easy to use as a ebook reader
"Not sure if this is due to the new version but I'm not able to install or even sideload certain apps onto the tablet. Amazon is really trying to lock out non-Amazon apps namely ones from Google. Aside from that though, performance is already and what you'd expect from a tablet in this price range. This was purchased for my mom and it does what's needed and my mom has no complaints thus far."
Tablet is working good for what we wanted it to do.
"Still waiting for Alexa to function. Several calls to Amazon supportled to conflicting answers on how to get it to work, then told it isnot yet available on all Fire HD 8 tablets."
"The Amazon Fire Hd8 has great features. The size is perfect to carry anywhere. Excellent apps and accessible to books, movies, games etc. Clear screen. it was very quick and easy to setup and begin using."
"I have had several budget tablet, but this blows them all away. You have to be willing to be invested in the Amazon ecosystem, but it is well worth it."
This tablet is a good one for everyday use. It is small but it has a clear image. Not sure if I really wanted one this small but its ok for now.
"This does not run Android, so no Google Play store. Amazone apps are moztly the same titles, but not all are available that you can get through Google Play. Bought this for our daughter and she enjoys it. If you have an Amazon Prime subscription you can get a lot more out of this tablet as well."
"Bought for daughter, love the parental control and curfew setting"
I like the portability of it. I take it with me when I babysit my granddaughter.
bought as a gift she loves it great with amazon prime
Had the previous version of this tablet and was looking to upgrade. Got this on sale and am very pleased.
My daughter love this tablet! Easy to use and carry
"The best kindle fire ever, love how quickly the apps run, being able to watch movies, listen to music, etc. on it"
The salesman was very good pointed us in the right direction. The tablets are perfect for our triplet grandsons.
Excellent value for the price. Super easy to use and set up. Wonderful display. I love the fact that you can add an sd card for more memory unlike the old Kindles. Plus I'm really impressed with the fact the Amazon has such great offers.
"I love my kindle. It fast, great pict quality and is so convenient to use. I love using it to watch Netflix. It worth the purchase if you don't want to spend so much money."
I love this tablet!! Excellent quality speakers and screen. Lots of storage space. Worth the money!!
Bought it for my husband and he loves it. This is perfect for what he wanted it for.
Very fast and super easy to use I'm very pleased with this purchase!!
It's works really well and don't have any issues at all
Tablet is good for beginners and those that like to read
The Kindle Fire has great features for the price. The video quality is asstounding.
"It worked really well for me as I am unschooled in ipads. I used it while traveling and it was easy to use and did the things I needed, i.e. maps, books downloaded, internet access, youtube, etc.. I don't play games, so cannot comment on that."
If you want a tablet to use on a daily basis for facebook or do online purchases you couldn't ask for a better tablet.
"I use to read books, watch movies, and get online.. it works great and easy to use."
I bought this to replace a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. I absolutely love the Kindle HD 8. It was easy to set up and very easy to find my way around. The only reason I took off 1 star is that I have found some apps are not available for Kindle. But so far from info I have read online there are ways to resolve this issue.
Just a simple kindle. Doesn't have the glass back.
Throughly enjoying my fire tablet. Can play games and read books. Am very pleased with it.
"Excellent screen , fast response. Almost a steal for that price."
Much harder to work than an android. None of the wallpaper apps I downloaded from the kindle store work on the device. many of the other apps look cheap on the display. other wise it is prettier and more responsive than the cheaper $49 tablet. They make it look like an android tablet but it is not. no google play. Everything is just harder to work than on a regular android BUT for a tablet under $100 it exceeds expectations. It is more responsive than other models of fire
Kindle Fire is a dream. Larger screen easy to read
I HAVE BEEN WITH AMAZON PRIME FOR 2 YEARS AND THIS NEW FIRE HD MAKES IT WORTH IT. i WATCH MOVIES WHEN I FLY BECAUSE I CAN DOWNLOAD THEM. THE BATTERY LAST FOR DAYS. I USE IT EVERYDAY NOW.
"Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge..."
"Reading is easy, can make font as large as you need"
Improved over the HD 7. Things set up differently but not hard to learn. Also a bit heavier than the 7 so reading in bed a little harder
"Not to much to complain about. for less than 100 dollars you get an 8in tablet that has pretty good specs; expandable storage, long battery life, great speakers, fast processor, decent cameras and hi def screen. easy to use and well built tablet....The only knock is the included adds but, after using it for awhile you barely notice it."
I've purchased a number of Kindle Fire products for family over the past several years and continue to use them. Easy to use for even my youngest Grandchildren or my 87 year old Mother-In-Law which they use as a reader and for games. An overall good value.
This is the fastest booting tablet I have come across. The speed at which I can access sites is really amazing.
"I went into bestbuy to purchase a replacement after mine died. I loved my kindle, and decided to get 2-in-1 with the fire. It is perfect for my needs."
"I had fire hdx 8 and loved it, unfortunately got damaged and could not replace. I purchased the fire HD 8 and exchanged n pay difference for fire HD 10. The 8 did not have a lot of options I was used to. :("
great product at a great price.i like the builtin filter which is easy on youreyes.probably the best reader under 100 dollars.
Very good product. Super quality and the Best Buy store rep explained me about the product
This is my third Kindle Fire and it improves each time. Colors are crisper and best of all it stays charged a lot longer.
"I bought this for my sister, who already had the Kindle 7. For the price the 8 is better. First the obvious. a inch more screen does make a difference and the HD makes reading and streaming alot clearer. Being able to add more storage with a micro SD card is a huge plus as well. This device includes a camera! And last at under 100.00 makes this a huge value for a great tablet."
Excellent. Just as good as iPad with a fraction of the price.
"The Amazon Fire HD8 (2016 model) is a great tablet for the price; however, the Fire OS offers limited abilities to the user. Personally, I wish there were ways to mirror the screen to a tv without having to purchase a Fire TV streaming stick. Also, the inability to use the google play store is a major set back. If it weren't for those two complaint, I'd give this tablet 4 stars."
I really love the new shape and size of the kindle HD. My daughter uses it and can control it great.
"I'm loving this new fire, mainly because I didn't fork out a couple hundred for it. My only beef is that magazines are formatted for the demensions of an iPad so don't look great on this"
Love my tablet easy to work and have no problem with down loads.and lite weight.
"Works okay as a tablet and especially to access Amazon.No good as a general tablet as there are no Google apps available, such as Chrome, gmail, etc."
I love this Kindle. I love the fact that you can use an SD card for more storage. Great job
The device is priced just right to give as a gift for an 8 year old
We have had a hard time with tablets and our 8 year old who has been down loading apps since she was around 3-4 years of age so far this tablet has survived everything except the constant draining of battery when used by her .
"I believe it depends on how you want to use it. I bought this for my young kids and they are loving it. They can do basic stuff like surf the internet, watch youtube and play some games. The only complaint that I have is that sometimes it does not charge, even if you have have it connected for the whole night. You just have to restart the pad so that it can charge, but that is the only glitch."
"Works well. I really like the bigger screen (up from the 7""). Easier to read, just as easier to use if not better."
"This tablet is great for anyone who uses this for the basics.Load times can be a bit slow for browsing the web or streaming videos, but once it's loaded, it plays without buffering as long as you got internet speeds that are good enough. This tablet is a good size and great for pictures, downloaded videos and music. For its price, it makes a pretty good gift for someone wanting their first tablet."
"Bought one for the kids to use while we travel, lots of good free games. Installed VLC media player from the app store and filled up the SD drive with movies. Now they are nice and quite for hours on end.Battery life is awesome!"
Can't beat the value on this. 5 stars even though it has less apps than the play store.
"I bought my Fire HD8 as an alternative to carrying around my laptop and having to buy many textbooks for college. The fact that I saved well over $150 on one of the 5 books I had to get this semester was a godsend. Most all undergraduate courses I have seen are offered in eBook form for Kindle. If you do not care about having the constant ability of being on the internet without WiFi or other hotspot, it's a great resource. Pros:Price for this was still less than the money saved for my Biology Book.A lot less weight that 5 college textbooks.So far all books I need for college are available as eBooks through Amazon.A single charge can make it through an 8 hour school day.Cons:If you want/need a network connection, you have to use your phone as a hotspot or connect to another WiFi network. Bottom line, I wanted a cheaper alternative to having to lug over $750 in books around. I came out at well under $500 considering I bought this."
My only disappointment is the inability to download some of the apps I use in my phone.
I had the previous model which was fine for reading but a little slow for other things. The extra .5 RAM makes a difference. Very happy and if you're a Prime member there are lots of freebies!
"I like this tablet. It has everything you want. However the apps within it need to be updated more often. If this happened than it would be top above an iPad mini. For now, it gives me enough of what I need and in HD. For $89 it was a good deal."
"Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has ""underground"" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that's on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it."
Great price of 89 dollars on a great tablet. It is very fast at everything accept game play. For example it plays asphalt 8 and the game is just barely playable. The graphics struggle on this tablet with higher graphic games. Also it is a Amazon tablet with no Google play store but you can load Google play on to it. There are great you tube videos on how to put Google play on a amazon tablet. The screen is good as long as the sun isn't hitting it. The stereo speakers sound great and loud. All in all I really liked the tablet for the price but I really like to play games with good graphic quality. So that being said I did return this tablet and ordered the Nvidia Shield 8 inch tablet through Best Buy for 199 dollars. I got the Shield a week ago and WOW!! What a difference in graphic gaming quality. This thing is just as good as an Xbox1 or ps4. The Nvidia Shield tablet is simply unbelievable for the price of 199 considering the Apple or Samsung tablets that are as fast as this tablet are at least twice the cost. Plus this dubbles as a gaming console for xbox or pc games with 4k out to you tv. The Amazon tablet is also a great tablet for normal usage but if your a gamer like me the Nvidia tablet is the tablet of choice hands down period!! I don't know why bbuy kind of hides the Nvidia tab only on their website and doesn't sell it in the store. If they displayed it in the store. This would outsell the Apple or Samsung tablets. I hope this helps thanks.
I find this fire much lighter and very easy to use
"I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar ""carousel"" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader."
Does great on browsing and doing research easy to use and love the features especially the private browsing a great price as well
Great little tablet for a great price. I keep it at work for listening to music or some lunchtime reading.
Wanted to travel without my laptop. Found the Fire to be perfect. Used it mainly for checking email and keeping up with Facebook posts of friends. Found the size of screen to be easy to read. Typing a tad uncomfortable until one has some experience using it. Have yet to use as an ereader.
great tablet to replace kindle. Love the features.
This is a great tablet for my teen. She loves it and the price can't be beat!
"This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful."
The kindle is great to read on. I also like that you can play some games.
I love the amazon tablet very much and love to use
its good performance and highly recommended to amazon users
"I bought this for my wife to replace her 7"" fire that was having a hard time holding a charge anymore. She is thrilled! It was easy for her to transfer all of her books and apps from her old fire to this. She mainly uses this for books , email and some games so this is the perfect tablet for her. better graphics and quicker with the 16gb storage"
"If you don't want or need something cheaper than an iPad but of quality, this is a great happy medium.The processor makes for a fluid ride with it. It's speedy. The Android Store gives you good app options and the Amazon ecosphere is everywhere here.The software is a touch buggy but it's still a great deal of a tablet.For a child, for something you want to use casually on a dime, it's recommended."
Easy to read. Light in weight. Has many good features.
"I read about this new 8"" Amazon tablet in the New York Times. My Google Nexus 7, 4 years old, was getting slower and slower, and I needed to upgrade - for as little money as possible.This Amazon Fire 8"" is an excellent value for the money(only $89!) - very fast, great screen resolution, and easy to use. I was skeptical of the Silk browser, which I'd never heard of, but it works fine. There is no ""page forward"" arrow, which is odd, only backwards, but I can live with that.It has exceeded my expectations and I'm very happy with it. I'm not in the Amazon ecosystem, this is my first foray, and it's a good one! Congrats to Amazon for making an affordable, great quality tablet!Also, the purchasing experience at Best Buy was easy and convenient, as always!"
"The new Fire HD 8 is an improvement over the Fire HD 7"". It is faster and the larger screen makes reading books much easier. I do wish the screen was easier to read when outside or in the car. Too much glare in those places."
Love it! I'm not computer savy but was able to figure out most things without any help.
Mother needed something since her tablet had died. Was lot easier for her to learn than her old table. She does lots more with Kindle than she did with tablet
Light to carry and good picture quality. This was purchased for a hearing impaired person to download video in American Sign Language . This product was easy to maneuver for someone that was not use to a tablet.
I love this tablet. I purchased them for gift and am so glad I did!
"The new Fire HD 8 tablet is a nice upgrade over the previous version. Storage doubled to 16 GB and the RAM increased by 50% to 1.5 GB. This makes the tablet faster and more responsive. With the improved battery life and much lower price, this is a great general purpose tablet."
I purchased it for my dad (70)He needed something easy to use. He really enjoys it.
"It a great product..,. The quality is awesome the pictures is good and clear..."
i have had not issues with my purchase. i found a great cover for it on line on amazon and use it every night. thank you for your service.
"This has a great picture, good size, lots of storage and a camera. Would recommend"
I went from the 7 inch Kindle to the 8 and it really made a difference. Easier to read and clearer than my old one.
"I love this Tablet. It's easy to use, a great price & lightweight."
"This is my second Kindle Fire HD. I was satisfied with the first one, but now I'm really enjoying the larger screen. My biggest need is to preserve the progress I've made in various games without having to replay them, but at least I have access to all my books, movies and games. Love the Kindle!"
"Love the product. I use it every day for Web,Games and reading."
"I bought this to replace my wife's (1st generation) Kindle Fire. She likes it even better than the old one, especially the pinsharp screen."
"Great Kindle fire, works great for reading, playing games, etc. Highly recommend to everyone."
"Very pleased with this device. Great price, easy to use, and light weight."
Nice upgrade from my old kindle. I like it very much.
"For the price this is perfect. I read books, search the web, watch Netflix. It's not an iPad but for the price it is amazing!"
İt is cheap tablet option coming from amazon. Latest model will satisfy your needs
"Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too."
"This thing looks nice, runs nice and feels nice and for the price I don't think you can find a better tablet."
"Got this for my 9 year old after her ipad crashed and burned. She does not like androids at all but I couldn't afford a expensive tablet for her. So we took a chance with this one. She is pleased and I'm pleased it seems so sturdy , not cheap quality at all. Going to get our youngest child one now. Very pleased."
"The quality of display is better than expected for the price. (Keep in mind that this is not an iPad!). Apps from amazon are well integrated and the functionality is fully enjoyable without limitation. Very satisfied with the product. This review is for Fire HD 8, 16 GB."
I like it but I had a hard time figuring things out.Do I get to talk to geek squad free? Can I come down to the store and get someone to help me with my questions.Will there be a fee for that service?
"Beautiful HD resolution on this tablet. Love the 8"" size, not too big nor too small."
"This is an awesome tablet, fast, great display and has all the apps I need for personal entertainment If you look for a great tablet for entertainment this is the best you can have, if you want a tablet for working applications this is not the one so be aware and buy this tablet if you want tons of entertainment. also it have a larger processor and internal memory and the external memory to keep all your photos is unbelievable I strongly recommend it, again, not for work but for entertainment."
"I bought 2, 1 for each kid. Easy to set up and figure iut. I went with the staff member's recommendation and I am so glad I did. I love the internet safety organ on it through Amazon. $2.50 a month per kid for unlimited age related and child safe Internet access and movies, books, games and apps and I can set the time it shuts off and a minimum time for them to read each day. Love love love."
"Good tablet, great price, easy to use, pick up simple"
Very happy with my kindle. Would buy it for my kids
"I am a power user; there's no other way of putting it. I work in IT and I research the heck out of products before I buy. I had an iPad Mini 2 that was just not up to snuff with iOS 10 so I sold it and bought (and eventually returned) the 2016 Fire HD 8. First let me say it's a great tablet for the price and for probably 50-60% of tablet users who surf the web and watch Netflix. It also helps if you are a heavy Amazon content user. For me, I was spoiled by the retina display on the iPad. The 720p display is alright, but you can see the pixels. 189ppi is pretty low by today's standards. The other big thing for me was the lack of a laminated display. It's glare city on this thing. Display nitpicks aside, it punches above its price point. If you don't play really heavy games (which it even plays Titan Quest surprisingly well!) and you don't mind not having an absolutely beautiful screen I think it runs and works fine. It just wasn't for me. I bit the bullet and went with a 128GB iPad Air 2 as its on special at BB for super cheap right now."
This is not a bad product. Amazon offers greats products but this tablet was missing features even for a basic tablet. The lack of google chrome compatibility made this tablet not right for me.
"So I got my Fire HD 8 originally for ebooks since e-copies are much cheaper. Very easy to use, especially if you are not tech friendly. So glad I got this."
"This was a good tablet. I bought it for my Gf who basically only wanted it for Netflix and YouTube. The display was good, not great. The issue we had was that it kept dropping the wifi connection. This could have been a defect in this one tablet but we returned it and got another one."
"Bought the Kindle for my daughter. It's the 4th we have bought over the years, one for each child. Great product"
"GREAT value for the cost - not as fast as a high end tablet, but certainly faster than I was expecting. Clear viewing and easy navigation"
"Husband loves the 8"" tablet. The screen is big enough to view what he is reading"
For first tablet I am pleased. An amazon name is good value.
Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.
This is a good product for the price. Many more things can be done with this fire 8 than we dreamed about.
Easy access to my Amazon account. Easy to set up and use.
"This item has a very nice readout, and is well built as far as I can tell. The overall size is very suitable, and the price was reasonable. I get great service at Best Buy every time I shop there."
Does everything I needed and moreI use it as a travel companion and the size is great.
Its so perfect for my niece & she loves it. Going to get another one for my son.
the performance is so much faster than my old one and the graphics are much better too.
Love my kindle it does everything I wanted I to do.
"I wanted a tablet that was easy to use that I could access my email, internet and stream shows/movies! It's perfect!"
As expected. I am very happy with this. This serves the purpose
Handy to use and size is good. It's light weight and that's important.
I got this for my husband birthday and he loves it
This kindle is great. Battery lasts much longer than old kindle.
"Where do I begin...good clarity, I love the size and storage capacity! Very affordable, love watching Netflix on it. I do wish I could have gotten the purple, got the color black, but overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
"I didn't think to much of it at first glad at the store, I decided to purchase it. IT WAS THE BEST DECISION EVER MADE"
I bought the Fire HD 8 & CaseI use it mostly for class..works very good..would be better if it had BlueTooth.
We have several kindles and this is the latest version. Its packed with Amazon marketing stuff which is fine if you use them but most just take up space for us. This new version comes with 16gb but allows you to expand the memory with an sd card which is great. One problem if you have a few other kindles is that they are linked to your account so if they are for different family members/kids they may end up with the same stuff on them. My kids mainly use them for game apps and YouTube videos which am seem to work great. The sound is good and the hd video is nice. Overall happy with it and the price was good for this type of tablet.
I went into Best But to buy another reader but ended up buying a Fire 8; good value and has the things I need in a reader.
Got the tablet for my grandson he's happy with it and use it as we speak
We bought this earlier on line from another vendor and it was never delivered. Best Buy was great.
Great buy. Bought it for my 10 year old niece. She loves it.
"I have always gone to buy a kindle because I like the books and th games available. But I found them very unpredictable and unreliable. The color burns futon screen, then the screens starts jumping. As a result I have purchased 8 over the years. Not sure if Want to go through that for the 9th time!"
"It's good, saves using up data usage on computer. I use it to keep up to date with the news."
"The Kindle Fire HD has a larger screen (8"" vs. 7"") and images are crisper with more vibrant colors."
Just lock the card out and let the kids go crazy!!
This is an awesome tablet perfectly for watch tv for my little nephew
My kids enjoy reading books and playing games on the fire tablet.
I'm so glad i brought this because it is very handy and easy to use too. Everything about it is good and I really like it.
"At the price it is almost an impulse buy. I wanted a tablet for an upcoming trip to watch some movies, read, etc and this was at a price point that made the decision really easy. If you are used to an iPad, the Fire HD is a little disappointing but it costs considerably less. It fit my needs but I felt some slugginess and several instances of needing to reboot to get certain apps to work correct. If you go in with the understanding this isn't an iPad replacement this should fit the bills for you. Let's just say, after my trip I purchased an iPad Pro and this item will likely be handed off to one of my children. If you have Amazon Prime, you do get some nice perks that make this a really nice item."
Easy to follow directions allowed her to set it up with me watching over her shoulder.
I purchased this tablet for my Autistic child. He loves it!!
I've enjoyed using my Fire HD8 tablet to play games.
"Beautiful screen, vibrant color, fast and best quality for the money."
I use it for downloading and reading books. It is the perfect size for this purpose. It is also very light.
Bought for wife who is not into the techie word. She likes it - suggest buying a protective screen and padded case for it.
My wife wanted an iPad. I bought her this because it was cheaper and good for reading and playing games. She uses iOS products so it's not compatible. She hardly ever uses it. Next time I'll get what she wants and not waste my money.
Much better screen resolution than my 7 inch fire.
"I bought this tablet for my Mom and she loves it. I used it myself and it's very easy to use and works nicely with Amazon Prime, etc. definitely would recommend especially for the price."
I enjoy using the tablet. I use it when I am biking.
This really a nice tablet.It runs great and it's thin and easy to hold.
This tablet is quick and as good as my iPad! I use the tablet specifically for one aspect of my life and it performs great! I am pleasantly surprised by its performance!
I have a 4 year old boy and 6 year old girl and 12 year old boy no cracks or broken yet yes they have dropped them no case but no cracks yet pretty amazing when they drop it on hard wood floors and still not broke!!
Wow I've had quite a few different kindles over the years and I've loved all of them. But this kindle fire hd 8 is by far my favorite. So glad my husband bought it for me the best purchase ever.
"Upgraded from a standard Fire tablet. Better screen, a bit faster than standard Fire."
In my opinion this the absolute best value on a tablet out there. No way to go wrong at this price
the new sound and the faster speed plus other improvments are great
"I am very happy with this Amazon tablet. I purchased it for business purposes, as well as recreational, and it works great for both. I did get an SD card for more memory. Also, if I would have bought directly from Amazon, there would've been a 1 month wait. However, I was able to order from Best Buy online, and pick it up that very day!!!"
Its perfect to see my tv series when i don't have my tv around. It has a very good resolution quality.
"I bought the 8"" to replace my old 7"". I love the bigger screen"
Freeze frequently... No way to trouble shoot or repair it...
I got myself 1 of these tablets and so far I love the way it works You can enlarge the print and change the lighting to make it easier to read. The only thing with it is you must have an Amazon account to use it.
This kindle rocks! Tons of storage at an awesome price.
bought it as a gift for my mother and she loves it
I love the fire....it works great and the navigation through the Fire is user friendly too. I think the 8 is the better buy for your money.
"BY FAR THE BEST TABLET IVE EVER OWNED, EASY AND QUICK SET UP"
This tablet is very good especially considering the price. also has memory slot to increase storage.
I bought this tablet over the holidays when it was on sale. It has been a great tablet. The battery life is great on these new models. Also playing games everything moves smoothly since it has more ram. The durability of the tablet is great. This thing won't break if you drop it. The only thing I don't like is the fire os. You can't get everything you can get on the google store so not all apps are available.
I have had a few kindle's in the past so this was nothing new for me but what I loved about this one is that the screen is big so when I am reading a book it's a lot easier than when I had the first kindle screen. I mostly use it just for the reading but being able to navigate the internet on it is great for when I want to look something up about the book real quick or if you want to search reviews on a book before purchasing. I love it!
Purchase this tablet during the Christmas sale. This tablet is a good tablet for a beginner. Easy to use and shows movies and videos very well.
Great tablet for on the go. Good size screen to watch movies or read book.
"Light, portable and great features. Highly recommended."
"For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with ""Silk"" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in."
Bought it for a friend he likes it.would recommend it.
This tablet was everything I was looking for: a cheap tablet that could download Netflix shows for offline viewing
"Unlike my first Kindle, this tablet gives me all kinds of information, advertisements and offers when I first turn it on. I could live without that, but overall, I am pleased with this new tablet. It does many things I haven't taken the time to explore, but hope to soon."
"This is a great tablet for the price. Would give it 5 stars if it had included some sort of instruction manual. Otherwise, definitely recommend."
This is a great tablet with great features. I love my kindle.
Can't beat the price on this tablet! Great for streaming or casual games.
Great for reading and Netflix. Fits nice in purse. Good price.
Good value at a very affordable price. Can't beat it.
Works great prety fast operating system dosent heat up
We love this so much in our home. We bought a super tough case and let our two and six year old use it. They love watching their movies on it and playing different apps. It is a really good value!
"Great tablet! Brought this for my wife and she loves reading off of it! Great price, easy to use! Great purchase!"
"Very fast, very functional. Love the e-reader function. Movies, music and internet work great. LOVE IT!"
"I received this as a gift from my husband. It's great for reading, gaming and watching Netflix."
"I exchanged a highly unsatisfactory Insignia unit for the Fire. I was looking for a 10 inch screen, but went to the smaller size for performance. I have no complaints with the Amazon product, other than the ubiquitous advertising."
My daughter loves her tablet. I had to make sure I brought a case because it is very thin. No problems and I can see everything she downloads
"Have a fire 7 and wanted a bigger screen, love the new one."
Perfect for our needs and an on the go mini computer and ereader.
"This tablet is great for books, audible books, music and all things Amazon. The included browser (Silk) is not the best. I purchased expanded memory (64GB SD card) for about $30 more and a cover for about $20. The biggest issue I have with this unit is that it is slow (when compared to an iPad) and it tends to freeze every so often. For about 2.5x more money, consider an iPad instead."
Great tablet use it for reading and email. Great price!
Nice little tablet. Functional and easy to use.Fits the needs that I need to use it for.
Awesome.and repeat 50 times. That should do it. Blah.
"I initially bought the tablet for school, I use Kindle to rent books but after using it to stream Xfinity, Netflix, and Amazon Prime I loved the sound and picture quality. I would recommend this to anyone needing a good low cost tablet with great battery life."
We have had no issues with this tablet. Love it!TY
For the price it's a bargain. This is a perfect solution for a reader and simple browsing. I use this at night before bed.
My first tablet experience and it's awesome. I love being able to stream movies and have numerous apps at my fingertips.
Bought this for my wife and she loves it! This was our third kindle over a period of many years'Can't go wrong for the price.
Love this tablet. Power lasts long. Short charge time. HD screen is really clear. Only con is that there are some apps not available like Google play. Very satified. Have a 128gb card in mine . Plenty of space for downloads. The camera has no flash and is not the best but I didnt buy this tablet for that. High recommend the HD tablet 8gb amazon fire. You want go wrong.
This tablet does all the things I really need. I have it some thought before buying I don use most of the features a more expensive computer/tablet has. Have been very happy with my purchase.
Got this for my wife's birthday. She had an older model and wanted an upgrade. She seems very happy with it and uses it every day
Very user friendly...long lasting battery....very clear display
"Worse graphics, won't keep a wireless connection,overall not satisfied"
Easy to transfer my stuff from my old Kindle into this new one. Love the price and how easy it is to use. Great buy.
"This is my first kindle. It works great for my use. Mostly reading, email, and Amazon shopping."
"Amazon Fire HD8 is one of the best deal at 89$. Strong, efficient, low price and some Amazon features that I love. Youtube videos of how to get googleplay and android apps have made things lot more easier. And now, microsoft office is available online for free that I can access and edit my documents. What else do I need? Amazon is more respectable brand name than other low price brands or used/old models of high price brands. Definitely recommend it."
I held off getting a tablet and wish I had done it sooner. The Amazon Fire 8 is great and easy to use
"i have been looking at tablets for a long time, most of them a little expensive for what i would use it for. This tablet lets me read, email, searches and the best part I can buy books through amazon and not have to carry heavy books with me when i travel"
"Not the highest quality of tablet out there, but for the price you almost can't beat it, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member."
I liked the screen size and easy to read books at night. The battery has a long life. The outer rcase could be stronger because concerned about durability.
Works great for everything we want our daughter to do
"it's wonderful. I love it. It's easy to watch movies, play games and read books."
love it just like my other one just better!!! since I already own a kindle I knew this was what I wanted. Just needed a second one and a little bigger. Always loved the service and help I get at BB so I knew I would purchase it there!! Found salesman to be knowledgeable and most helpful. Thanks so much for your help and service
New Kindle replaced my old Kindle that had a lot of books. To my surprise the book transfer worked well. Seems to work surfing the net. Music sound is only okay.
Great little device that does almost everything a Tablet does. I use it as my computer when I travel as well as a reader.
Has meet all my needs plus some. Recommend you buy a good stylus pen at the same time.
It fits just right in your hand. Light weight. Love it
I extremely happy with my purchase. I like that the screen is just a little bigger and much faster.
"Good picture, works well, great variety of apps. keep in mind that you get apps from amazon, not google play, so they aren't always the same or same price"
"This replaced my old Kindle Fire. I have not yet explored all of the features but, so far, it is performing very well. Tablet is a good size and weight, and easy to use."
This tablet has been the best one for the price we have purchased 3 other tabs for our kids and they have all broke and ran super slow they love them would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to save a buck but want quality
I would recommend this product it is a good tablet to use have had no problems.
"Kids love it, under $100 so the price is great. Don't have to worry about it getting mishandled as much. Still can't get them off the ipad though."
"I went with this tablet based on many good customer reviews, but my experience was not a good one. From the start I was on the phone every day for at least an hour with Amazon tech support for one issue or another. Most of the techs were very polite, but not all knew the product very well. At one point I asked one of them about trying to save some RAM and they kept referring me to the storage, which told me they didn't even know the difference between RAM and regular storage. The internet browser was basic and it ran very slow at times, even when all my other wifi devices ran great. Then a day would pass and I'd be trying to type an email and the keyboard would just stop working...wtf??? Come to find out it's a ""known issue"" and ""they're working on it"". After two weeks of one thing after another I got fed up and just returned it. I wanted it to work, and gave it a good run, but just not quality stuff. To me it was like Walmart trying to build their own computer when they're obviously not a computer manufacturer, neither is Amazon. If I were you I'd look at a regular Android tablet from a reputable PC manufacturer, which is exactly what I did next. I got an ASUS tablet for only a few dollars more, and it's unbelievable. 1000% better in comparison to the Amazon Fire HD8. Save yourself the aggravation and go with ASUS or some other company that is specifically in the computer business full time. Sorry Amazon, not this time!"
"Not very fancy, but not slow. If you have Amazon Prime, you have a access to a great library of TV shows and Movies for free. Same goes for free book rentals. The Amazon App store is not so great, lots of apps are outdated but still work. Just not the latest versions you would expect. But the Amazon Underground appstore does offer free access to games you would normally pay for. It's decent for it's price and a good deal if you don't want anything fancy."
I love my Kindle fire. Had a Kindle and it disappeared. Enjoy not having to go to library for books. I get a great selection of books every day.
Light weight and easy to use. Very user-friendly. Durable.
For the price the tablet can not be beat. I use this over my ipads that i have. There is nothing i cant do with this tablet
I recently upgraded to this tablet; it is everything I wanted. Highly recommend!
It was a good buy and tried this for a day. It was fast and experience was good.
"I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the ""walled garden"" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point."
This is a great tablet for the price! I bought it to replace my iPad mini. Great for ereading and general browsing.
"This replaced a Kindle 7 HDX with 32GB of ram. The older tablet had a charging port that wasn't functioning anymore. Had the Geek Squad warranty so they issued a full credit for the old tablet and my son chose the HD8 as his new tablet. Other than the screen resolution being lower and less memory, great tablet. My son didn't care about the resolution and the new Kindles let you pop in an SD card for more storage. Popped in a 64GB SD card and he's a happy camper now.. ;)"
"I purchased this as a gift but have had extensive time with it. It's a great budget tablet, phenomenal screen and a very smooth interface. Handles all apps and HD content well."
This was a birthday gift to my husband. He really likes it and it does what he needs it to do
"I ""retired"" an earlier version and this new souped up model more than meets my needs, and the battery lasts so much longer!!"
I have a kindle and wanted more options. I love the bigger screen. I find it easy to read. It can have some reflection under lights but not much.
"This tablet is easy to set up, has great resolution, and is perfect for reading books or surfing. The price is affordable, too. It is perfect for anyone who wants a fun and casual way to use technology."
"This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one."
Really enjoying my new tablet. I like to travel and me and my family use it to play game and watch movies. Just the right size to.
Liked this Kindle upgrade. The color screen and backlights allowed for easy night use
"I enjoy the new kindle, only things I would like to change is the way screen darkens and lightens while reading. Not sure how to stop that. Occurs consistently. Also, would like to stop the ads seen each and every time kindle is turned on to start reading again. That is bothersome. Otherwise, am happy with the kindle."
I purchased the 8 inch device. Also purchased black cover.I played for it and asked if I could get it set up and was told it would be 40 more dollars. I did not have 40 more dollars so I left the store with my kindle and had someone else set it up for free. I was disappointed I had to get someone else to set up my kindle.
My previous Kindle was dying and I wanted a new replacement fast. I went to Amazon and while they had one it was back ordered a month. Expecting to pay more I went to Best Buy and not only found it for the same price but even better it was available at my local store and I could pick it up the same day!
I got this for my son to play games on soI could get my iPad back. Personally I think it's a great little tablet for kids and or for reading. Other then that it's not a high powered game playing tablet or anything to keep lots of storage on. But it works for what it's intended for andI have no problems.
Easy to use You cant beat it for the price you pay
This Kindle is larger than my old one and book reading is much easier. Some features I don't use so can't comment on them. All in all I love it.The only drawback was that the store had no covers that fit this Kindle.
"We purchased this as a replacement for our now-broken iPad. Though we liked the smaller size (more convenient, easier to carry, etc), the internet was sooooooo slowwwwww that it drove us crazy. Sometimes minutes to download a site (and this with no other apps open!1). Plan to go back to another iPad."
Tablet is great and easy to use thankfully because its my 1st tablet
This is an item that is easy to use for novices. My child uses it and has no issues
Easy to use. Pretty user friendly. It is good value for the price
"No problems with tablet, kids love it and the size is great"
"My nephews love to play with my phone. Now as anyone who has been around small humans knows they have an astounding ability to perpetually have something sticky on their hands. However, if its a rare case where they don't they will probably drop the device from the lack of said stickum. The kindel has come to my rescue as it has everything they need to be entertained. And best of all it lacks the anxiety inducing price tag for that moment when the kids demonstrate Murphy's law in action."
Was a present for my 14 year old grandson. He was very pleased.
"The Kindle fits me to a ""T"". Very quick to start. It shows how to get things done."
"For under $100 this 8"" tablet is a bargain. I do all I want on it like; check email, Facebook, Twitter, watch YouTube, read books, and shop on eBay or Amazon. I've been very pleased with my purchase."
Bought this for my wife for our anniversary she loves it
I love to read and this tablet work great for my needs.
"I know beforehand that this is not a powerful tablet. But it's the best bargain at this price point . The screen is okay if you just read books, news, or surf the websites. But if you want to enjoy videos-this is not your choice.The processor is slow and the amazon app store doesn't have all the apps like you'd expect from Google appstore- even though the OS based on android. But few tweaks let you install the Google playstore-search online for the steps.Overall I'm satisfied with my purchase. Hope this is helpful."
"I bought it for my grand daughter, she knew how to use it right away. You can purchase a rubber case in different colors for protection."
It is just an average tablet. Bit slow but is a good option for people on budget
Very nice for reading and watching videos. Strong wi fi is a must. Slippery to hold so buy a cover
Tablet stopped working after owning for two weeks. Came back on after an hour.
"This device is great for the price! I use it for my daughter and after having seeing the ads on amazon, I thought this would perfect for her."
"I think that the Amazon Kindle tablet was a great purchase for my teenage daughter and grandson, very easy to operate. It kept them entertained for hours while we were traveling on the train for vacation."
Great device. Works very well and use it throughout the day.Keeps me informed and great for looking up things and staying in contact.
"I love my kindle, I can listen to music,read my emails, or pick a book to read. Everything loads up easily."
"I really enjoy my new kindle, still getting used to it."
I have done this like 5 times now. Don't send me this ahs8n. Getting aggravating.
"This is an affordable tablet and works well, you just have to deal with a lot of advertising."
"Love how I am able to run the latest Minecraft on this device, but am not able to on a 3-year-old iPad. It seems as apple handy cap their devices. Resolution may not be the best, but for the little buggers it works fine"
"I love my Fire HD8 I got it because my Kindle(the original) that my husband bought me died and the Verizon Tablet wasn't working great for me. So I came down and the agent at store showed me this one, there is a learning curve but it gets better and takes a while to learn but I love it."
"Does all the basic stuff I need at a great price. I use it for some apps, web browsing and some video. Picked this over the Fire 7"" for the screen size, resolution and CPU/GPU. Battery life is pretty good. Ads aren't too annoying.Far cheaper than competing name-brand budget tablets while doing almost everything needed at this level and probably better supported. FireOS will always be a little behind the current Android version and I'd rather have Google Play than Amazon, but this still allows for side-loading stuff.Recommend if you're ok with living in Amazon's world and/or proficient enough to load other app stores or packages (or know somebody can)."
"this item work just as I expected it to, great product!"
"This is the third Fire we've purchased, and Amazon finally made this level memory-upgradable. That has made all the difference. I bought Fire tablets for use as a 'kid tablets', for which they work great...until you run out of memory. 8GB is practically nothing these days (I remember when having 64kb was a HUGE upgrade to my Atari!) so being able to toss in a memory card give my kids much more utility."
"Have a nook , this is much better has more apps and thru amazon"
I love the size and the HD quality. Just what I was looking for!Downloads apps really fast!
Never thought a tablet at this price could be this good. Totally recommended!
This is my sixth unit and has features many of the newer models didn't have.
Thank..............................................
"I had the original kindle fire for ten years and I loved it. But it broke on me and I decided on this one after looking at all the upgrades from the original. It let's you do so much more, but some of the tutorials (like for the internet) weren't helpful."
"Lightweight, nice display and not too large to carry."
this is the perfect size for an older person who uses it minimally.
"Good tablet, satisfied. One point annoying...silk browser makes Yahoo email a list and have to tap HTML to read each one...Awkward."
I love the apps that are on here and everything else I think it's the perfect tablet for a beginner has all of the apps that you will need
Love this tablet. 16GB memory but have expansion slot. Bought 128GB micro SD card for $56. Love this feature
I love Amazon Fire HD8... It is so easy to use and perfect for reading books on or cruising Social Media. I love that it has Alexa included on it.
"I love my Kindle for reading manga and comics. The fact that the graphics are worse than my phone detracts a little from the expirence, but serves to remind me that I cheaped out and bought yesterday's model. This is not a real negative, it just appeares less crisp than my phone. The increased picture size more than makes up for it in my book."
This thing lasted not even a month before it went dead. Going to try and take it back
Bought this so the grandkids could use it. They already have one at their house. My husband has been using it also & he likes it. He has never used a tablet before but he has enjoyed it.
This is a fantastic tablet for the price. This is a great alternative to an IPad.
I had an original Kindle that I replaced with this newer one. I love it!!
My 8 year old loves this so much to do on it. She enjoys reading on it play games .
I purchased this tablet for my 9 year old son and he loves it. Nice bright screen and has two speakers for pretty good sound for a tablet. Great for games and watching videos.
This was purchased on Black Friday as an impulse buy and we absolutely love it! It was a great price and the size of the tablet is perfect. It works great!
Great little tablet for someone who is always on the go.
I love my tablet no regrets the pic are great I recommend it!
It's a great item to have when you are out and about. It's easy to connect to Wi-Fi and it's small enough to fit in my purse.
Nice product for the price. It does what we need it to do. Easy to use and handy to have with you instead of a heavy laptop.
This was a surprise when we opened it up! Bright and colorful!!
Nice look. Great memory and camera. For this much money everything is so good.
Bought this for my niece for Christmas. She mostly uses as ereader and checking email.
I'm happy with my purchase is all I can say. The only complaint I have is that the 3.5 mm Jack is right next to the volume button and it gets in the way.
Good tablet for the price. Nice display good performance.
Loved my first kindle so the upgrade to the new one was practically seamless.
This is I think the best product I've bought. I already own eight that I've purchased through the years for my family and they seem to only get better and less expensive in price.
I have been completely satisfied with this product. The quality of graphics is great and downloads are a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product.
"I bought this as a present for a friend, and he uses it all the time. The HD screen is crystal clear, and this tablet competes well with the bigger names."
My dad is a first time user for anything techie he has really enjoyed it.
If you enjoy reading you will not find a better device. Excellent price for a product of this quality
Bought this for my great granddaughter for a gift. She loves it and it is easy for her to use
Was bought for a Christmas gift. My 11 year old son loves it.
"A friend of mine was in the market for a new tablet. I had researched the Fire tab for some time and liked the specs, which met her needs. I decided to buy her one for her b day, SHE LOVES IT!"
"Works great with all the Amazon stuff, like Kindle, Alexa, etc."
My kid enjoys the tablet. This one is inexpensive than ipad. The availability of apps are limited.
"I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain."
im always using my amazon tablet...perfect for games!!!
Great price. Fantastic gift! I would recommend this for a gift for all ages.
I love to read! Having the Kindle Fire is like having hundreds of books at my fingertips!
Bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. Reads it all the time!
Great all around tablet. Color and resolution is very nice. Best price for a nice product.
Bought for my son as a birthday gift and as a way to not wear out his laptop. Works great especially for videos and general online use.
"This was an impulse buy. While getting a bigger, faster and much better tablet for my wife I decided I'd get this for myself. It did the job just fine, but after about a week I returned it. I just didn't find myself using it wnough to warrant keeping it. The price is awesome and if you don't mind it being a bit slower than other, much more expensive, tablets then I don't think you can go wrong."
I use this all the time. So much better than bringing out the laptop.
"This tablet is definitely recommended if you are looking for light to medium usage. Tablet is snappy and quick but slarts to lag after installing multiple apps.Amazon app store is good but there are few essential apps that are not available, though you can install them using black market."
Nice it all ready has Amazon and apps built in. Great buy.
Bought this tablet for my wife and she absolutely loves it. I also use it for school which works great with writing notes directly on PowerPoints
So far so good. This is replacing a broken kindle fire.
Bought this for my husband. He has really enjoyed it.
Great for my son. I monitor school work and apps he downloads.
"I love my kindles. This is the 4th one. The others I wore out. I enjoy this one the most . Easier researching things , lot more options etc"
Very good value tablet. Does everything pretty well. Brightness isn't great. Battery takes a while to charge but lasts forever. Decent buy. Would recommend.
Really enjoy my kindle. Fits perfect in my purse and the screen is a good size.
I bought this for Christmas for my husbandand now I 've had it for months. I am still happy with this purchase. It has a nice screen and is easy to see what you are viewing. I will be buying another one for myself soon.
I really like the feel and ease of use. It's a great tablet for the price.
This is a great tablet. I was surprised at how efficient and easy to use it is. I bought 8 of these for gifts to make Bible study easier for a bunch of friends.
We purchased this for my wife's mother. She likes to play games on it and do some reading.
Needed a new Kindle. Wasn't sure what one to choose. This one is GREAT!
This product is OK but is not the best you can get. for a sale item fine. battery life seems to be a little short. Bottom line.....So so
So far I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Great product for a great price!
I use this while underway and it's a perfect size to travel with
Love it. Great gift. Awesome for those who don't have a tablet or never used one
Works great with my amazon prime account and for browsing Internet and playing game. Cheap tablet as well.
"Had it for about a week and now it won't take charge, tried new chargers and still not taking charge. Happy with tablet but unhappy about not chatging"
Overall I think the Kindle Fire HD is a great product. No complaint so far.
I am extremely happy with my purchase. The kindle is very fast and the screen is clear.
"Great tablet, fast & reliable. Only downfall is having to pay to remove adds."
It all of a sudden has stoped charging I have only used it a few times in the short time off purchase. Can I get a replacement or how best can I be helped
"The Fire HD8 tablet is so easy and fun to use. Take it everywhere. Love that it is easier to see than a cell phone, for those with old eyes."
My wife's mom wanted a tablet. This was a great way to get her into technology and she LOVES it. Not iPad or galaxy but good start.
I purchased b/c my old kindle fire finally bit it ...screen went dark. Very happy with this one. Cost is great. The screen resolution is great. User friendly. My favorite feature is the SD card so you can add more gb.
Bought it for my daughter. Works great Store personnel did an excellent job
This is a reliable brand and a good product for price.
Our son just LIVES this unit. He has all his favorite games on it.
"I bought this kindle for the extra size. I have recently been having trouble with seeing clearly so I figured with the size it may be easier. It was and I really like being able to change the color of the fonts and background, it seems to help immensely."
Great budget tablet at a great price. Long battery life and high quality display.
"I traded this in after receiving a 7"" at Christmas and I am happy I did. I love the size of the screen for reading my books (which I have too many of) and a great size for watching movies. I do wish I had the capability to use internet when I am away from home, yet other than that, this is a great buy."
"Overall I like the Fire HD8 tablet, hard to beat at that price point. Sure the more expensive tablets are faster, brighter, better, but for the money and casual surfing it is just right. Good companion to Prime Membership, wouldn't be half as good without."
This is great tablet. Its great for people who don't need a lot of apts. or store a lot on it. Doesn't over heat. Light weight.
I was going to get a Samsung tablet but for doing everything this is better
amazon tablet is great. no google bloatware. everything is amazon. one thing i didnt like was. ads on the lock screen and no way to turn off.
"Bought this tablet to replace a 3 year old Galaxy Tab. This tablet is quick and easy to use, relatively streamlined. The screen is nice and the stereo speakers, while tiny, sound better than my old tablet. The modified Android system that Amazon is running on this tablet is good, just a bit restrictive. All in all a good tab for general browsing and popular apps.Pros:-Price-Performance-Feels sturdy-Easy to navigate-Silk browser works greatCons:-Not all apps are supported on here, like Telegram-Ads on lock screen feel unnecessary, but not a hindrance-Not as customizable as other Android tabs"
"I needed to replace my old reader, and found that this model was just as good. if not better, and at a greatly lower price. I have enjoyed using it for about a month, and am very please with it."
I didn't expect anything less than what I got with this Kindle.
Bought this for my daughter to replace a worn out ipad. She is happier with the size. The resolution is nice. Great buy for the price
This tablet could be so much better if the apps actually worked decently. The built in Amazon pieces for Prime members is great and work flawlessly. But it's not enough to overcome the terrible app behavior and countless freezes.  They need to take a lesson or two from Apple.
"I have only used this a few times so far, but I like it. The lightweight and pretty easy to navigate. Perfect screen size too. I ended up purchasing a second one for my fiancé."
The size of this table is great I'm able to carry it in my purse with no problem!
Really nice customer first service. I have had other Kindle readers before so was familiar with the unit.
"I bought this tablet mostly for watching movies. I downloaded movies from Netflix and watch them during indoor bike training at the gym. I love the ability to expand the memory with a microSD card, which iPads do not. It's pretty fast and has all the features I need. I read kindle books with it as well. The drawback is that some apps are not compatible with this device. The iPad is definitely more powerful and compatible with many apps I use, but this is a great tablet for most of my current interests."
"Before the 8 inch kindle we the old 7 inch one, which both tablets are great but this one so much nicer. The screen is bigger, more storage amd Love the color on the back. Great Tablet"
"I'm enjoying the longer battery life, faster processing and most of all the ability to expand the memory. Highly Recommended!"
She loves it . it's the best thing we could of ever brought her
Bought this tablet for my son and he has loved it. It's so easy for him to use and easy for me to set parental controls.
Nice little tablet for the money. A few ads to deal with.
I use it to read books. Have read a lot of books on it. The right size and lighting for any situation.
I bought this for my computer loving 89-year-old dad. Now he can check his emails from his chair rather than having to go into his computer room!
"Bought on Black Friday for $60, add a trifold case, portable TV while I do dishes/cook/anything"
Got this when it was on sale which is what really made it worth getting.
"Tablet works well, slim design is perfect. Highly recommended to purchase this tablet."
Perfect purchase for me. I take it everywhere and is so easy to use!
"Purchased this a couple of weeks ago, no complaints so far. Web pages load pretty quickly on the Silk browser, and the battery life is excellent. After installing Google Play Store (it's really easy!) even more apps are available. Can't beat this for under a hundred dollars!!!"
"After having a basic Kindle for 6 years, I moved up. I am thrilled with all this product can do. I am an avid reader. The Fire let's me do that and lots of other things. I am still finding apps, and other things it will do. I know this sounds ""old fashioned"", but it would be great to have a user's manual! Thanks for asking."
Bought as a replacement kindle for my mother in law. She loves it perfect size for her.
This is my 4 the Kindle and is well worth the price.
My wife loves this tablet.Much easier to use than previous 2 tablets that we purchased.
It's great!! Light weight! Charges quickly! Great features!
Will not seem to charge all the way and this is my 7th Kindlle.
Nicer than my old fire. Better screen area to view
My husband and I both use this and really love it. We got kindle unlimited for the books but it's also great for playing games and surfing the web too.
Love my new Kindle Fire - easy to use - the battery life is amazing!!
Perfect size for reading watching movies and carrying on a plane
I upgraded from a 7 to an 8 inch. What a difference. Totally satisfied would recommend this to everyone I know
and it out performs some of the bigger name brand tablets out there. if you looking for a good video and somewhat customizable tablet at a great price do not pass this up.
"If you need a basic tablet then the fire works. It falls apart when compared to the iPad mini from a usability, functionality and available apps standpoint."
"Worked great but after awhile I wouldn't unlock. After I'd enter my pin, the screen would go black. I took it to geek squad (luckily I bought the protection plan!) and told me they don't fix them they just replace them. So I got another one but that one did the exact same thing. Ended up returning that one too."
"seems a lot better, does not have the open cover feature, which I miss, but still getting used to the differences and trying to get my thing back on that I had on the old 1"
"Really easy to use, nice size, works great, affordable price, extra card slot for storage, bright screen, good speakers, easy to download apps,"
"This is my third Kindle. My sister bought me my first one and I said I didn't need it and probably wouldn't use it. I was so wrong! I use it everyday. When it died, I bought another one and then a third. I can't live without a kindle."
I bought the kindle fire 8 for my husband and I to use. Neither one of us have been able to figure out how to use it. Every time we open it advertisements pop up. And we just try buttons to remove it. We cannot get it to rotate for our puzzles. Just too complicated to use and to navigate around. I will be returning it. We have an iPad and it's much easier.
"bought this for my niece and it works perfect, she easily navigates all menus and features..."
An inexpensive tablet that can satisfy your reading and viewing pleasure. Fast and good quality product. Recommended!
"Bought this for my 2 yr old. Easy to use. Good parental controls. As long as you're not comparing it directly to an iPad, then it's a pretty good tablet for the $$"
"like it at first, but it is going slow sometimes. overall good product"
We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.
"Great little tablet to take with you, great for kids"
Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.
I like this and the price is right enjoying it now
I Bought this as a gift for my daughter! She is diabetic and losing her vision. I am hoping the large text will be easier for her to see so she keeps reading.
I have ordered a couple of these for my family members and say that they work great and do everything that they are supposed too. Highly recommend.
I have a nexus 9 but it is painstakingly slow so I wanted something that does not lag Everytime I try to use the browser and does not freeze whilst playing games and this gets the job done very well. The battery life is also very good. Highly recommended for casual browsing and games.
"Great tablet, only thing needed is a better camera. However, for the price, it can't be beat."
"Lightweight, performant, and packed with features. This device is great for reading, music, or movies on the go as well as web browsing and email."
"Easy to use, like lighted screen for reading in dark"
Better than I expected for the price. Works good and I would fully recommend
I am very satisfied with this product. It performs extremely well in all areas of its operation.
We bought one of these for my daughter to help with her learning. There are so many possibilities with this. It's way cheaper than an Ipad and does basically the same thing.
"I absolutely love my Fire tablet. Great size, lots of space and a great reader. I can't recommend this product enough."
"I like this tablet, its thin, light and easy to use. It's great for kids and adults as well."
Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : )
The first Fire HD8 we purchased died within 1 week of purchase. We had to go back and exchange it for a new one. Not a good sign so far.
I I bought this for a friend since she liked mine so much.It is a great way to check emails and read Kindle e-Books.I keep an SD card in mine and store my books on it. You can just drop this in your purse to read on the go.
"Husband is a first time user, he is doing really well with it.. He has low vision problems and this made reading his favorite books a lot easier to read."
It's actually a very good product for a decent price. Not lightning fast but it is okay for everyday use.
Love customer service very knowledgeable and helpful
Very good tablet for the price economical and the ability to carry in backpack
"I bought this Kindle for my husband's birthday. I have had a Kindle since 2013 and I used it mostly to read and check emails while travelling. My husband is not particularly a book reader, but he spends way too many hours alone, in his office, reading his face book messages. Now, with the new Kindle he actually multi-tasks, in the living room, on facebook, email, and internet, at least in proximity to me, so he might even join me in a conversation! I think his Kindle has much imporoved our 35 year marriage!"
It is easy to use. It was cheap. Have not found anything about it that I do not like.
i really love this product because it lets me read books and surf the net
"Love this tablet. Bought it to be my touch screen remote for my harmony hub, but use it for so much more now."
make sure you buy a micro sd card with at least 64 gb of memory. or you will have to constantly delete old items.
"This is a good product but the one I bought stops working after three or four typed sentences and the Geek Squad guy told me when I brought it back that I had to go into settings and clear the data when it does that. WRONG ANSWER. That should never have to be done. He had no idea what he was doing and North Haven Best Buy didn't offer to fix or replace my Kindle. This is the third product I have had to go back and either return or exchange because it wasn't working properly or at all. One manager tried to excuse the store by asking me if I understand Best Buy doesn't actually manufacture these products. If that is the best they can do to explain why they, as the Point of Sale, keep selling defective products, the North Haven store has a big problem."
like the speed the 8 inch screen is great. Works well.
Up and coming new technology helps everyone to enjoy life more greatly
This is the perfect tablet for my purposes. Easy to use and the perfect size. Not too large and not too small.
This device is s really good piece of electronic. It is a good reader and also is very good for my 2 year old granddaughter to use.
"For my son as a present for college books. 5 textbooks were 1/4 the price on kindle than if we bought them on Amazon, this is my third kindle. Other two still working great,"
"I bought this to replace a 7""fire hd tablet that broke. Amazon changed the operating system so it took me a while to figure it out. I set this up for my son with special needs. I tried to make it as simple as possible for him. It is a little bigger. The sound isn't as good as the previous fire tablet. It also seems very slippery. I got a rubber honeycomb type cover for it. That seems to help us to grip it better. Over all, it's a good tablet for a child. Just use parental controls, and get a good cover for it."
"Reciever of this really likes and and says its a step up from the fire hd7, so I guess that is what counts."
"My bf got me this as a birthday present from my son. It's just like my 7"" although larger. I cannot tell the different between the regular and the HD and I game on it. I'm not sure if it cost more, but wouldn't waste the money if it did."
"Noticeable improvement over the fire 7 inch. If you're a first-time tablet owner then the fire 7 inch is a great device. But if you've owned a tablet with higher specs, there is a noticeable improvement with the fire 8 inch . The Fire 8"" has a better display and faster processing."
Very satisfied for $39.95 sales price. Way faster than I expected.
"I purchased this for a small child to use. She is quite happy with it, however it was a little too slow for my taste."
"My new Kindle is an upgrade from my 7 year old Kindle Fire. As to be expected the video quality is better along with faster performance and more features. I still use my old Kindle as it is still ticking but the ""shiny new toy"" is fun."
"This is the second Fire tablet that I have purchased. The first I returned in after I was not able to load YouTube onto the tablet. Amazon's take on Android was just to unfriendly to make it work. With this new tablet, Amazon has heard my concern and now I'm enjoying this tablet. It's well built for a sub-$100 device, but won't stand up to a lot of abuse."
"Reliable, price efficient device. Easy to use for all ages."
"I can play games, surf the internet or watch movies. I can check my e-mail or just about do anything I can do on a regular computer.I strongly recommend it."
"This is a terrific tablet at a great price. The quality is excellent, the price is right, it has tons of storage capacity. And oh, did I mention that it's cheap? (Cheap for a tablet, that is.)"
Had a great experience with my Best Buy rep! Great Job!
"Small, portable and very easy to use. I have not had any issues as of yet."
I purchased this product on a whim with a very limited purpose which was to study for an exam while in the middle seat on a long flight. I expected to hand it to my 10-year old after my exam. The surprise was that really enjoy the device and in particular I like the Amazon account integration: On my next flight I was delighted to find that the unit actually downloads my videos for offline viewing! The best part is that I upgraded the memory with a 64GB SD card so now my available content is awesome! Truth is that my first unit inexplicably failed but Best Buy replaced my unit right away and I expect great things with this new device! My son also uses it on long trips!!!
"I bought the HD Fire 7 for my wife,I liked hers decided to buy the Fire HD 8 for myself I love it.Nice graphics easy to use."
Able to download music and movies free!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I have used the Kindle mostly for reading. I have downloaded books from Amazon, some free some purchased, that I have heard about for years and now will read. I have also read Manga from the Internet. My use of the internet has also included looking up gardening hints, animal care, and dog breed characteristics."
Need to have some computer savvy. Wound be much more helpful if it came with a simple basic instructions.
This was a gift for my son and he loves it. It not only helps him with his homework but he could also play games on it!
"You cannot top the value at this price point with any other tablet. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the limited app selection through the amazon app store. If this came with the google play store, I would give it a 5 in a heartbeat. Overall it is a great tablet at this price point. I would highly recommend it."
Great for my mom who isn't tech savvy. Luv it! :-)
Very smooth tablet no lag at all also good battery.
Love the kindle will continue to buy them for my family
"awesomeness, love how i xan watch my xfinity movies"
This tablet is not only a great price but exactly what I needed for quick Internet access and to download books !
I purchased the Amazon Fire HD 8 to replace my 2nd generation Kindle Fire. It works great and the colors are sharp.
The 8 is bigger and lighter weight than my old 7 and the battery life is longer. It also has more storage and a camera. Love it!
"I lost my tablet in Germany and wanted a replacement fast. Best Buy, had both the 7 and 8 inch Kindle fires in stock, after reading the reviews, I decided to go with the 8 inch. Boy was I glad that I did, the larger viewing area, is great for watching movies and Netflix on the airplane. The 8 inch has stereo sound , unlike the 7 inch which has only mono. Overall I am really happy with this tablet"
Pros - HD quality for low price. Works really well with my Amazon account to access multiple Amazon features with extreme ease. Couldn't be happier. I have iPads too which are extremely versatile but they came with a big price but not this tablet. Love it!
"We bought this one and a black one for our kids. It's very durable and good price for the quality. For myself personally, I still prefer my iPad, but if on a budget, you won't regret the investment. It's so simple I sometimes struggle using it. The free time experience is awesome for little ones and I can set parameters, which is a huge bonus. For a first-time tablet user, this is a solid product."
"A very good product by amazon. Considering the price, even better."
"Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot."
Excellent product. I would definitely purchase again.
"After using this tablet for a while, I have found that I even prefer this size over my iPad Air. Easy to carry around and long battery life make this my preferred device. The screen is just the perfect size for my older eyes, the screen on the 7"" fire is just too small and cramped, and it seemed a lot less responsive. I highly recommend this sweet tablet."
This was a BIRTHDAY GIFT for my LITTLE one and she LOVED it!
"I purchased two of these as Christmas presents for my children. I had been researching child friendly tablets with robust controls to keep them away from undesirable content. I found the 7"" Fire Kids Edition, but after looking over the specs and reviews, I found myself unsure of it. I was mostly interested in the FreeTime application, so I did some research on that and found that it was available on other Fire models also. I came across the new Fire HD8, which had more power, a better screen, and far better battery life at a very affordable price point. I gave them a shot and I'm glad I did.I have the Fire HD8's locked into FreeTime mode, so the only activities that can be done are ones that I approve of, but if I want to, I can pick up either of them and unlock them to access Netflix/Amazon Prime or anything else I desire. I currently have reading goals set up that they must achieve before they are able to access videos or games, and those are limited to X amount of time per day. FreeTime also has a bedtime feature which disables/enables the use of the tablets during designated times, which is amazing.The hardware itself is exceptional. The screen resolution is excellent, it's very responsive, and the battery life is spectacular! They advertise up to 12 hours of battery life, and depending on screen brightness, ours last almost that long regularly. The only con I can think of is that the cameras are sub-par, but that's not what I purchased the tablets for, so it's a non-issue for myself.Some of the reviews I read cited that the internal storage was easily filled with FreeTime content, so I installed 128GB SD cards in them. I also purchased some rugged children's cases for them off of Amazon.This is probably one of the best purchases I have made in a long time. The sound of silent children reading all day is priceless!!!"
"I bought this tablet for my sister to replace her kindle. We love it except for the fact it would not connect to ATT internet. I suspect this was an ATT problem. The internet could not be authenticated. Since we have had problems with ATT for seven years, I am sure it was a problem with them! Once my sis read the instructions, she was good to go!"
Great tablet for a kid enjoys very much would buy again
"Overall, very impressed especially when compared to my iPad mini 4. This tablet does it all and makes for an excellent e-reader, while also boasting specifications that rival any iPad."
"works great for us for video calling, for kids watching videos"
My wife loved her gift. I made the right purchase.
"I own two Amazon fire tablets with this one being the same as owned.. My sister in law wanted a tablet and since I owned one just like this one I figured it to be a good buy.. She just loves it, she is able to do her scheduling, read books and watch her news programs.. It's a great Alertanative to an iPad... great price and just as powerful for a lot less cost.."
"These Kindle Fire tablets simply can't be beat in terms of value and bang for your buck if you have an Amazon Prime account it would be a crime not to have a Fire tablet.Good strong build quality, very nice bright screen with a strong picture and good resolution. They are pretty responsive, have good battery life and can handle the abuse of letting your kids use it as well."
We bought this tablet for our son in college and he loves it.
"This is my first tablet and it's going well so far. I purchased this for reading and streaming. There have been a few hiccups with regards to a streaming video buffering for a long time and sometimes I have trouble with response on commands, but overall, I'm happy. It's been a nice device to have for reading online material offline."
Replaced my hd fire 7 because broke screed. Very pleased with the large screen.
"My only dislike is that being a Kindle, my Kindle books cannot be sorted into categories. It's harder to find new books I've downloaded some time ago when I have to search through all of them."
Purchased as a gift. The receiver loves it and said that it works nicely.
Purchased this for my 80 year old mother in law to replace her old cracked screen one. Everything was perfect easy to use and set up. She has zero problems using this for online and reading books.
Love it I sent one down to my family in Mexico they loved it
Bought this as a gift for my mother. She absolutely loves it. Easy to set up and use. and the price was right.
"I am loving this tablet. My previous tablet was a 1st year Fire. This tablet is great for reading, games,facebook and emails."
This is my third Kindle and I have loved them all. I still have my first Kindle and use it. I just wore my Kindle Fire out with 5 + years use. I am very happy with everything my new one can do. No disappointments at all.
I got this for my husband for his birthday. He likes the light weight and the speakers and how powerful it is.
Got it for my Dad. Easy to use and he loves it. Good stepping stone for future producs
One of the best purchases or investments you could make for technology.
I bought it for kindle books and was amazed by its overall features. Its Kindle with features of a TAB.
"I bought this primarily for reading, but, being a tablet it is able to do so much more! I can listen to music, download movies and check email. I love it! Way better than my Nook!"
"Great tablet for price! Fast, works great, great sound volume, great pixelation and screen size"
"I'm new to tablets but this one is pretty easy to understand and use.There's a decent amounts of apps at start up, which can be good and bad."
i would buy this item again. however charging port is
"so far. A few not so great things, modt of them managed to resolve them though."
This is a nice little tablet and Great for the kids
Not a huge fan of products that aren't Apple but this one is good. Haven't had any problems with them at all.
I bought this for my sister as a gift so she need not use her laptop for basic internet surfing and to watch movies while travelling. The device speed is decent although you cannot compare the performance to a laptop. If you want to avoid carrying a bulky laptop during travel and want a budget make do device for laptop then choose amazon fire tablet.
"I got this tablet for my mother and cousins. It's been very speedy to my surprise, not as fast as a high end tablet but no lag and a very nice 720p display with good build quality. Would definitely recommend if your looking for an affordable tablet"
YOU PAY FOR THE BEST AND YOU GET THE BEST. THANK YOU BEST BUY FOR PROVIDING THIS PRODUCT
"I have an older Kindle and enjoyed it very much. However, there is so much more improvement in this tablet with faster processing speed, upgradable storage and longer battery life. I'm really happy!"
"This was the perfect tablet for what my husband wanted. 8"" size was not too big or too small. You can carry it without it being clumsy to drop."
I love my kindle.It is user friendly and there's so much more than I thought.
Great little tablet after you add google play store. Takes some research to do.
Awesome tablet and great value for money. My son is enjoying it a lot.
"I bought this as a cheap alternative to an old, slow, iPad 2, until I could spring for the iPad Pro. Got it as a Black Friday deal, so it was more than worth it. Was able to add some missing apps that make it even better than I thought it could be, and having Amazon Prime makes it an inexpensive and handy media device. I carry it in my bag at all times without having to worry about it's value. Can't beat it for the price."
"I love to read! Books,books, books and more books."
"Longtime Apple user, but for this price vs an iPad you can't beat this product!"
Easy to use. Great picture clarity. Wish they had a cellular version.
I got this because it was a cheap tablet. It does great for watching videos from the tablet and sound is good also. I don't like the amazon ecosystem or app store. I wish they would sell android tablets with their apps on them like they are doing with their phones.
This is a good tablet to own. I like the features.
My son needed a tablet to take notes on at college classes. He wanted something small and lightweight instead of taking his laptop. He's found it to work perfectly for what he needs!
the first worked fine for three weeks then stopped. took back and got a replacement. this one lasted almost a month. again took it back and was told I had to deal with Amazon.Found out thru Amazon webpage that units simply froze up and how to reset it. Was upset that store associate knew nothing about the product. Had to research everything myself.
"purchased for my sister for reading books, internet and games - perfect for beginners and novices. Easy to use. Would be a five if available with 4g"
Love the added space. Easy to move around in. I am excited to use all the new features.
"Gave as Christmas gift,and wife loved it. She has not put it down since she has gotten it."
"I love this new Amazon Fire HD. I have a 6 year old and I've set it up so that he has his own password and he loves to read all the free books available. The different shades of back lights are cool. If you purchase the new Amazon Fire HD, it will enhance your reading experience."
I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
We had an old Fire and upgraded to the Fire HD. Love everything about it so far.
"The fire tablet is a great tool for reading, surfing the web, playing games and even watching some Netflix, on a bigger screen, without killing a cell phone charge."
Great value! This tablet is great for everything. It's not as powerful as an iPad but the price can't be beat.
"I like that it is a good reader and that you can also put some apps on it -- I use it to check email, one note, etc. but primarily as a reader."
Got this tablet cause I wanted to start reading more graphic novels and manga and was very impressed with it it runs smooth and even use Hulu and netflix on it. My only flaw with it is that there are ads on your lock screen though you can take them off for $15 other than that it's a grade little tablet!
My wife wanted this and I got it for her. She has been totally happy with it. She loves it for its size for reading online books.
I am very pleased with my purchase the tablet is a great project is there a product is very versatile
Great tablet. Easy to use. Will recommend it to others.
"If you're looking for a small but effective tablet that's reasonably priced, this tablet is the one for you. It's easy to understand the directions, therefore making it a snap to learn how to work the tablet. It comes in different colors and is easy to read and use. Give it a try. Thanks, Best Buy!!!"
Very competitive Price - Unit works well we like color and size
"The HD8 and HD7 are amazing for the price. They aren't top powered tablets, but they're functional tablets. Right now, in Feb 2017, either one is a good replacement for the Nexus 7."
Bought this for my niece and she loves it. Very easy to use from what she tells me!
I really liked the build quality but the very lackluster performance and minuscule battery life didn't make it a keeper for me.
"Such a a great tablet that does everything, love it!"
"I am an avid Amazon user for shopping and tablets, I bought a different model for my younger brother and now purchased this one for my grandparents and they love it!"
"I purchased this for my parents who were always viewing facebook or other videos on their cell phones, this Amazon tablet is perfect for them! It's user friendly and if you have an Amazon Prime account has great access to movies and music."
"I've had iPad mini's before so this tablet in my opinion can't compare. However, that being said. I bought this tablet for the purpose to watch Netflix and read books on. In my opinion it handles these two task perfectly. The screen isn't as clear and crisp like other tablets but hey I didn't pay $300 for it either. I like this size and it seems fast. I'd have to say I like it a lot. On another note, I'm giving this review only 4 stars because i am absolutely annoyed at Best Buy and their shipping. This is about the 3rd time I've ordered a product and had it shipped to me and Best Buy said it would be here at a certain date and UPS screws It up every time. Don't have any issues anywhere else but always when I order from Best Buy and have it mailed to me. Anyways, the tablet is good for the price and I'd recommend it over any other lower end teblets."
"I bought one for my 9 year old son for his birthday - and now we are buying another one for our ten year old. We have had some tech issues as we are juggling three tablets on one account - but with careful monitoring, it's ok."
Wonderful little buy! Tired of my bulky tablet. This one stays charged a lot longer!
"Nice tablet with the slightly bigger screen, great for tv, movies and reading especially for older eyes. Good size as well, it fits nicely into a purse or tote without being too heavy"
I like because I can download movies to watch offline with netflix
I bought this tablet for my mom on her birthday recently. She loves it and uses it all the time.
I always wanted a tablet and finally decided on the amazon fire 8. It is awesome and I love it.I downloaded some games and I am enjoying them. It is great for internet too. Definitely worth the price. You get a lot for the money. It had lots more options too.
"It was okay, but most of my apps were stripped down versions on the HD-Fire. It was inexpeisve, but you get what you pay for. The O/S is pretyy premitive. The hardware does fell nice. I would say it is the perfect device for an older or younger person."
ok for price a little slow and doesn't have as many apps as google play.
"I have owned several kindles. I don't know what I do to them, but they tend to die rather quickly. Thank goodness for Best Buy's extra protection. The last two that quit on me were replaced quickly and effortlessly. Excellent customer service as well!"
"Love using this Kindle to look up real estate sales, play mind games, and take pictures. Love the bigger screen and the great resolution. Sound is also far superior to my older model Lindle."
Wife loves it. She said it opens much faster and likes auto updates for apps.
Super easy to set up and use :)Got one for daughter and got one for self!!!!!!
"the tablet is great, but all the advertising is annoying"
"This Tablet does absolutely everything I want! I can watch TV Shows or Movies, check my Mail, Facebook, Google.......pay all my bills. It processes fast and has a beautiful screen. As I said: Everything I want in a Tablet for less than $100!"
"And she has been happy about it ever since. Not being that tech saavy, this specific device has a user-friendly tutorial to help get started."
"Got this to replace the Samsung tab A 7"". That Samsung tab lagged a lot but I haven't seemed to have as much problems on the fire tab, the only downside is that the battery dies fast."
"I have had a Samsung Tablet for 3 years, and I have to say that I love this Amazon Kindle 10x better. The picture quality is amazing, it is light weight, it is easy to navigate."
"Great tablet, great screen, great price! Very user friendly, especially for a not so Tech savvy person."
This is as good as my my Ipod! I would recommend it
"Needed a new tablet for reading books, movies and surfing the Web. This meets all my needs!"
Great upgrade from Kindle Fire. Reasonably priced for product.
I would recommend this to my friends that you can shop on amazon has many preloaded games. Many Apps
Great Product and great Price! Love it i would recommend to anyone who is looking for tablet on a good price
Simple and easy to use!! The wife takes it everywhere!
Easy to use! Just plug in and search for your favorite movies and TV shows.
"I love my new Fire HD! I had one of the first generation Kindle Fire, and loved it, love this one even more!!!"
I didn't do any in depth research on this particular tablet. The price and speed were good for what I wanted it for. My only con is not being able to clear the home screen of apps or relocate them so I can see my personal home screen picture.
I gave it as a gift to a friend who is a senior citizen who had an Amazon Paperwhite. I thought this would be a lovely upgrade for her and it has been. She loves it!!
Great device very functional love it will recommend
Bought this for my Father-In-Law for Christmas and he loves it. Easy to use and has already bought 5 books for it!
Can't say enough good about it. My 10 year old loves it.
"Enjoy the Kindle, fun games, can access the Internet, read books, etc."
The tablet works just great and the price can't be beat!
We did get this when it was in sale for about 50$ and for that this is an incredible value tablet perfect for anyone who wants a screen without paying premium prices. Build quality is fine and screen isn't the best but definitely usable.
It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook
The screen is clear and tablet is faster than i expected. Great colors also!
Not the most powerful tablet but is flawless when utilizing the Amazon programs
"Bought this for my elderly mother who was wanting the ability to read and/or listen to books. After a slow start getting her going (she is not tech savvy) she is really enjoying the versatility of this tablet. Although it does not have cellular data ability, which she had no use for, it gives her the flexibility to connect to wireless networks when she makes her weekly casino visits."
"For the price it can't be beat. That being said I had to return mine after a week. I just couldn't get over the low resolution screen. It works well for movies and the Web, but I needed it to also show off my photos to others."
This was a gift to a friend. So far she loves it..
Books and magazines are easy to access and read!!!
Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn't work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this.
"As I reviewed different tablets, this tablet kept coming back as my best option for the items I was looking for. It IS a great tablet, but there are a few things I don't really like about it. I didn't realize that Amazon has it's OWN browser SILK. Everything even your banking info goes through Amazon. Not sure I like that. Also, items don't automatically close out when you leave a page and I have to frequently hit the button on the bottom and close out multiple items. It might just be that I am not THAT computer savoy, though I do know how to navigate my way around. Sometimes the touch feature just seems to freeze and won't recognize that I am attempting 'touch'. Lastly, the on/off button is right where you hold the tablet on the side, so I am often 'accidently' shutting it down. Most annoying! Overall, I am happy with my purchase and for the price I like it. Just wanted to point out the other items."
serves all my needs in a economy tablet and I would reccomend it to all.
Good product with best price available in the market place
Tablet is a great tool to use the world wide web and check email.
"works great, wife loves it. Always happy with the kindle"
Has a few quirks that are disconcerting bur overall a great product.
Only a few quirks when it comes to this Kindle. Better quality sound and display.
Great tablet. Picture is super sharp and so easy to read.
I picked this tablet up for a 5 year old grandchild as a way to learn how to use a tablet works fine .
"We previously bought a 7 inch, 8 GB Kindle for my son which he used a lot. Eventually though he dropped it and it no longer worked. This past Christmas we purchased the Amazon Fire HD8, 16 GB.This model was an improvement over the previous one. With twice the internal storage, my son wasn't always coming to me to delete games because he ran out of storage. Another great feature is the external SD card slot. We bought a 32 GB card and he's not had to delete anything.The quad-core processor is a big improvement over the previous gen model. Apps and games load quickly with not lag in running them. There also seemed to be an improvement in the battery life so it doesn't have to be charging all the time or plugged in the the power cord.This is a great purchase for any child!"
Excellent product.Relable.Maximum speed.Fast downloading
Love this tablet. It's big enough so I can see. It works with my prime so I can watch movies or stream music.
I purchased a Kindle a few years ago and Have loved the flexibility it give me. I can browse the internet without moving to my desk to get on my personal computer. I love the fact that I can continue to read my books while I travel. Doctor Office Visits seem to just roll by more calmly now because I can ignore the office chatter and the TV selections I rather not watch. I encouraged others to make the purchase and several have done just that. This is my second purchase. Love It!
I purchased this for my mother and she has been going on about how wonderful the Amazon fire is. It's the perfect size easy to use and she can even do her banking on it which she loves. I would definitely recommend the Amazon fire thank you
"This is my second kindle. I love using them for reading, web searching, etc. I download some of my favorite knitting patterns, so when on the road I have something to work with.I love love love this kindle. Bigger screen, slimmer and lighter."
"Great tablet just what my wife wanted, loves the wifi, much better than her old one."
Was a gift and they love the tablet! Its a great price and works awesome!
The amazon fire tablet 2016 is quite good. It provides sufficient content & ability to do all of the basics one requires in a tablet. The 8 inch screen is bright and provides various settings. The tablet's light weight makes it very portable.
Need to buy a tablet for my Mother as a Christmas gift. Functionality is great and she uses it for all her online needs
The Fire HD 8 is the perfect size EReader. Big enough to see the text but small enough to hold comfortably.
"I bought this Amazon Fire HD8 as a Christmas present for my wife. It is the second tablet I have given to her over the past 5 years. She LOVES it! It goes wherever she goes. The Fire is more than portable and so easy to use. As the saying goes: ""A Happy Wife Means A Happy Life"". I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the Fire to anyone!"
Gave this to my daughter for Christmas. She loves it. Uses it every day. Good buy!
"I use it mainly for reading e-books and browsing. However, I wished there were more apps available. Also, before unlocking the tablet, ads are shown in the lockscreen. If the tab is locked, it stops streaming the ads. You can pay $15 to disable the ads permanently. I only recommend this for basic use. If you want to use it for games or other apps, I would recommend a stronger tablet like the ipad or samsung galaxy."
"This is my second Kindle Fire, and the only reason is because I upgraded. They're a great little tablet. Very versatile and fast loading times. Definitely recommend."
Good quality android tablet. also makes a very nice gift.
I purchased this for my 12 year old and it was at a great price point. I like the parental controls feature with the multiple profiles. This allows me to control what she has access to which is a plus for me.
Thanks perfect for my little kids they love this tablet good quality and fast enough for them
"Can't say enough about the Kindle Fire. It literally is fiiiiiiyah... fast, easy to use, and an all-around perfect tablet. Recommend keeping an eye out for special pricing at holidays to save some cheddar, but otherwise I'd say pick this little black rectangle of portable interwebz awesomeness up the first chance you get."
"The best product for the money. East to use, great color, great features. easy to set up and battery life is great."
This was a gift for a family member they really enjoy all the options of getting books
"I bought this one for 40$ during the black Friday sale, as a gift to my cousin. He was flattered by the performance, even I didn't expect it to be this good! It works flawlessly with the usual games and apps, what you are going to miss the most is YouTube, amazon's app store does not have youtube. Other than that it meets all my requirements for daily use."
Best B It is helping them to learn to read and follow directions .Best Buy had the products and provided great customer service. Grandsons are enjoying product use.
This tablet exceeds its reviews. its easy to use and the screen is great.
"My husband and I purchased the new Amazon Kindle Fire HD 8 tablets for our 16 yr old son and 12 yr old daughter for Christmas. I have an older version 7 in myself so I already knew we were buying a durable tablet. The new ones are awesome and they had them in colors so very easy to distinguish who's is whom We purchased during Black Friday and got them for $30 off, which was an amazing discount and made me love it even more. We had shopped around many places prior to and. They are light weight and the screen is plenty big enough for them to watch movies, play games, do homework and video calls friends and family out of town. They seem to have plenty of space and nice to know that we can add memory if we need to.The tablets hold up to the everyday life of the kids accidental drops kicks and their 3 yr old sister lol. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for a new tablet for themselves or children. Will buy again in the future if these ever quick working."
"Bought it for my little grandson he likes games, he can play with it where ever there is wifi."
"the tablet was on sale for a good price, and they had enough in stock for the CHRISTMAS season> grand children were thrilled."
"Good tablet and a great price. I use it for reading, Netflix and email."
"good for beginners play games ,take picture and recording videos old the time"
Won the kindle fire 6 last xmas2015 at work raffle. Gladly got this kindle fire 8 for a bigger screen and better battery life. Love it.
One of the best inexpensive tablets on the market. Great for the casual user
"Loving this tablet, 5 stars in my opinion, definitely worth it. Easy and fun to use. Also, a perfect size even for a man's hand."
Bought as a gift and they love it! Great for the price.
"I went in to buy my 88 year old Dad an Amazon Fire book reader....The customer service from the begining was great!. An Associate immediately approached me, showed me several models, with explaining them all. After picking one. I was then told of the ""free shipping"" of which i did utilize. My dad received within a couple of days , on his birthday, and was able to go to his local Best Buy, and have an Assocate show/explain how to use. He was sooo excited and pleased with the item and service....and so am I. Also, the price was right tooo!"
This is a great reading product. Love the light adjustment in low light areas. I can adjust the font sizes for my reading comfort and I can do other things like download apps or watch movies!
i really loved my 7in. but i love 8.5 in. a whole lot.!!!!!!!!!!!!!thanks guys!!!
"I bought this 8"" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7"" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8"" Amazon Fire HD. Can't beat the price for a Tablet."
"My son loves it, he can watch videos, read books and play games."
"Excellent and inexpensive. ITunes store and Google Play store have more apps to choose from, but this is still a very useful tablet. Expandable SD micro memory a definite +."
"Have not had time to REALLY use it, but hope to download books and games."
"This is a great, easy to use tablet for the price."
It's a 16 GB mini-computer and camera perfect for trips.
enjoying reading via the device; lots of options is also a plus; a little heavy to hold when reclining
"Needed a present for mom, at first she didn't use it much cause she had to set it up but now it's great and she loves it."
Bought this for my 83-year old Mother. She loves it!
We bought it two days before it went on sale for Christmas and Best Buy was excellent with price matching
asesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
performs as designed got it on sale for 79 dollars
"Is great for my son 8 years old, they help with homework"
"We own an ipad,samsug tablets and we have both love are fire8's wave better."
This tablet was affordable and it's pretty decent.
"Bought this for my dad, he is 87. Very easy to use and setup. He loves it and uses it 3/4 hours a day"
"At first was going to get a iPad but I decided to get this instead way cheaper then a iPad and just as good, love it.."
Couldn't recommend this more for kids. Price and features are awesome along with parental controls.
The functionality is great although I wish it came in more colors.
I didn't actually use as I bought for a gift. My grandson already had one so we returned for a pair if 3-d goggles.
"use as a reader and music, games watches movies i good all round tablet"
"Just thought we were purchasing a capability to download and read books, magazines, etc. But, for such a low price was surprised at the total capabilities available."
"I GOT THE FIRE HD SO MY KIDS COULD READ BOOKS , PLAY GAMES AND WATCH THEIR SHOWS . WITHOUT SPENDING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR THE TABLET. I THINK THIS IS A GOOD TABLE FOR KIDS / YOUNG TEENS WHO WANT TO HAVE A TABLET BUT NOT BREAK THE BANK."
We bought one for my wife and my mother-in-law and they both love it. Very easy to use.
My kids love it. Battery life is longer than others.
"This was a gift for my mother who is 99 years. She used to love puzzles, but with arthritis and failing eyesight she couldn't do them. The puzzle app is good because she can see it and use finger to slide pieces. She can keep up with family on Facebook"
Very decent tablet. I was skeptical at first but it's performance surprised me. Battery lasts a decent amount of time and connects beautifully into the Amazon ecosystem I already am in. Would recommend to anyone who likes to watch videos/browse the web on the go or for children.
"I purchased this for traveling. I can access my e-mail, books and games without lugging my laptop. I'm sure I will learn more as needed."
Best buy was very helpful & the tablet is good for reading books & basic serfing
"This is a perfect size and weight. Everything is very clear, sharp and large enough to be comfortably readable."
Word has it that relationships are interrupted by electronic devices. Well my girl takes her reader everywhere we go. She used to tell me I talk to much. Now I can hardly get a word in edgewise!
This is smaller and lighter than my previous fire and works even better
"It's not a $400.00 tablet so what can you expect, except that it does what it's suppose to. It's faster than I thought it would be so thats killer."
So far I love this tablet especially for reading. The battery life has also been good
Everything I expected with none of the drawbacks I have found in other tablets
Works well. Probably best android tablet you can get for the money.
Great tablet. No problems at all. Excellent Price.
the only downside of it is that you can't have google playstore on this tablet but you can still install it manually since they both based on android os
I bought it for my mom after moving her into an assisted living place. . I was able to use it a little to show mom I was very happy with it. Seems fast and easy to use.i like it better than my phone . :) Didn't get a chance to see how camera was yet.
I love everything about my new kindle except for the fact that the charging cord is already loose.
Great for those who love to read this tablet is always ready for on the go trips
Bought the fire for my mother who is 72 to learn how to use a computer the price was right and she can use it to search the web
"I only have an older ipad to compare this to, but there is literally no comparison. The Fire 8"" tablet is lightweight, connects ultra fast to wifi, has an easy-to-follow automatic set up, and comes with tons of features that I'm only beginning to explore. I wasn't expecting this at all! I'm a total convert especially because the price is so reasonable, too."
This is a great Tablet. Love the features and resolution
Super fast. Lots of storage. Great tablet for anyone.
bought as a gift for Christmas. they love it!!!!!!
"This is an upgrade tablet from my first Kindle Fire that I purchased 5 years ago. Love the larger screen the quick processing and downloads, the great HD visuals, and most importantly all of my previous pictures and music files were easily transferred/accessed by this new device. Love that this Fire has a front and rear camer too, my old Fire only had a front facing camera. Granted this is not an iPad, but I don't want or need all an iPad does. And I definitely don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a device just because it is cool. My Fire tablet does everything I need or want and it costed under $99.00. I am one satisfied and pleased customer."
very easy to use I live my fire the best purchase I have made in months
"The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix"
Gift for Mom. This is her first tablet. She is having no issues so far.
"Great value for the price. Easy to navigate and has good picture quality. I bought it to watch Netflix, browse internet, read books on Kindle, and watch YouTube."
Very nice tablet for low price. The shell feels a little on the cheap side but added a cover (Fintie) & feels much more sturdy. Great for reading or watching netflix or amazon video.
"Purchased this to get a lighter tablet. Also to update our my old tablet which had a replaceable battery. This is all around lighter ,thinner and easier to handle. HD is a good upgrade and can't beat the price for comparable tablets with same features. my wife reads on it daily and loves it. I am probably going to search for another one.We have the 8"" and I would like to try a 7"" if it were available.I like to try different size devices to see how I adjust same way with todays phones."
I'd recommend this highlyGreat buy for the priceGood graphics and easy to use.
Good product bought it as a Christmas gift. I will be purchasing another one soon.
Wanted one that played bejeweled blitz. This one does not.
A gift to my 3 year old grandson. Great graphics and sound.
The size of the Fire tablet gives you the feel of having a book in your hands while reading a book. Because of the size and lightweight it's easy to transport and fits easily in my purse. I'm enjoying my Fire tablet which was a gift.
The tablet is Excellent! Very fast and well worth the money! The display is great!
I got this for my kid as a gift so he could read books easier and it has helped a ton!
"I got an 8"" windows tablet for my father in law and we quickly realized that windows is not a good choice for someone that is not already comfortable with all the windows features that are not tablet friendly. This tablet on the other hand, had a very easy learning curve and my father in law became comfortable with all the features in a couple of hours. I would definitely recommend it as a gift."
"The 8 inch Amazon Fire 6th edition is by the far the best tablet in the Amazon market. The 7-inch is a nice size, but the 8-inch has better screen resolution and longer battery life. If you are an Amazon Prime member, this is a must have tablet. Also, the Amazon magnetic case does a great job in protection and sleek-ness."
I bought four of these for my kids and they love them
Great tablet for my childthis tablet was just everything that I need it for my child
Very easy to use and small enough to travel with. I slide it right into my bag.
I would recommend this ereader above all others for its high quality and diversity. Not only as an ereader but as a web browser.
I got my father a Amazon Fire he's never used a tablet let alone a computer. So it was a challenge. He did pretty good but ha's a hard time seeing the screen.
I love my new Kindle Fire even more than my old one which I lost.
Very good buy. I am enjoying my new tablet. Great buy!
"Learning all the aps that are on the Kindle, the games and all the free books."
"Perfect for a kid and it was cheap! My son has broke a lot of tablets, this one seems durable."
I travel a lot and this is perfect for watching movies or reading on the flights
The Kindle is great! It's easy to set up and I've found all the books that I wanted.
"I got this on an impulse buy, mostly for my 16+ hour flight, but also just in general. Was in line buying something when I saw this at an unbelievable price! So I bought it and have no regrets! For the price ($69.99) it's a great tablet, though you can only get apps through the amazon app store not the Android app store, which limits you. But that's alright, as I mostly got it for watching videos and movies and that sort of stuff. And occasionally some games!"
"Great tab and the price cannot be beat, Only gripe is the fire os. Oh well"
This tablet is great for the price. It has good connection to wi if. The kindle store is a breeze. The picture quality is good. And seems to be the perfect size. A nice alternative compared to The more expensive tablet. And much better quality then the less expensive tablets I would recommend
I bought two Kindle Fires for my 4 year old twin grandsons this past Christmas. We downloaded lots of educational programs for them and they absolutely love it! No need to buy them an IPAD which was far more costly!
"I have had every version of the Kindle since the week it was introduced and jumped at the chance for a Kindle Fire. I replaced the first one I had in 2014 and it was everything I wanted except this past summer it started overheating and got nonresponsive in the midday heat. So...I got this one. First of all I miss Swype. WHY get rid of it? Secondly I cannot put two of my favorite apps (which work on my old one) to work on this but lastly and most importantly: every once in awhile the screen freezes with a bunch of code ""shimmering"" in the background and only turning it off and/or leaving it for awhile brings it back to life AND it turns itself off. It seems to happen when I close a program and move to a new one. Aggravating and not what I expect from a product with which I have been happy in the past."
My granddaughter love this fire for al her games. We also downloaded a music app for her and she is so happy with this. So many things she will learn how to do on this tablet.
"Bought a Kindle Fire for my wife several years ago, our son is now 9 and he had kind of taken over the tablet from my wife. So we decided he was responsible enough and bought this for him for Christmas. I cannot believe the improvement over the previous Kindle Fire we own. The screen is more clear and bright and even seems more detailed, apps load faster, it connects to the internet faster. For the $89.99 they currently sell for I would say it is an excellent value. If you can wait, we paid less at Christmas so a lower price could be seen again."
We've had three of these Kindles. They are well built and you can't get the quality in a tablet from any other manufacturer. Amazon has great support with them.
This was a great purchase! Love the fact I can download TV or movies and watch off-line. Easy set up.
I bought this for my wife she loves how easy it is to use and small enough to take on trips.
"I bought the first edition kindle fire years ago. My kids loved it so much that I bought this product to replace the old one. They love this one even more. Larger screen and more memory, you can't go wrong!"
Gift for my grandpa so he can do internet searches from his chair and play games. He loved it. It's simple to use and inexpensive
I love my kindle fire it's is good for watching movies reading and anything you need a tablet for.
"We get this after my son broke his Samsung tablet and I told was android operating system but wen the time to set it up came, takes me a little lounger to make a new account, password and paretal control for my kid but am happy that finally did it"
This was a replacement for an Amazon Fire tablet. This was a an up grade for my daughter who broke the screen on her old one. She absolutely loved her old one. She says the new one is even better.!!
"I bought this kindle fire for my teenage son so he could use it at school and play games on the kindle, he loves it."
You will not find another tablet like this with the affordable price.
This tablet is small enough to pack but the screen is the perfect size for watching movies on the plane when traveling.
"love the ease of use with tablet, have not had any issues"
I highly recommend kindles. I wouldn't own anything else. I love reading and this is the best device yet not only for reading. This has wifi capabilities. I would highly recommend this item.
"I had Microsoft Surface, unfortunately daughter dropped and cracked screen so needed a new tablet. Since went back to laptop for work didn't need another Surface. Settled on 8"" Kindle HD over Samsung and IPad mini due to value. I only use for social networks, email, games, internet search, and occasional viewing of videos. This is a good basic tablet that can handle this no problem with a good wifi connection. Great value as I paid under $100 during the holidays and it has been as good as my Surface for these basic uses."
I recently upgraded to this model of Kindle. Liked it so much I bought this one for my daughter. She loves it. It's much nicer than the older model she and I had.
I had a very early generation Kindle that I loved. I was unwilling to update my Kindle because it was so great. The new one I got from my wife made it look like the old one was standing still. It's much faster and I love it.
"I love this tablet because of its user friendly interface. It reminds me of a starter tablet for kids, without being too much of a dull product."
Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it.
"Wry basic, but I guess, it's ok for the price. Bought for a 6 year old."
Bought as gift for senior. Setup process could be easier.
Nice handheld size. Clear text. Easy to read books on.
"Bought this for my daughter to use in school, she loves it! Product works great! I also bought the older version for my mom and she lives it as well"
"I would like to say this is my best tablet I have ever buy till now. I will rate it more then iPad Mini. Its best with battery, wifi, touchscreen, sound etc. I had other tablet for my kids earlier, but after having fire hd8, I will not recommend or like to go for any other brand in future. You can't get such good quality product in such less price. I am really very happy on my right decision to choose fire hd8 for my family and kids."
This is a good product for your money. It's basic it does the job.
Love the access to films. Easy to read and work with. A Little like an Android. I am used to IPhone apps but this works great once you understand it.
"Broke the screen on our 2nd gen fire so this is it's replacement. Easy setup, Much faster than older one. Just the right size for games, email, social media."
"This is decent reader and Netflix device. Lots of bugs and gotchas when trying to use - icons going off screen, random locking, random performance hits while doing the same task. Returned. Buying an iPad mini 2. The build quality is just not there."
Great and informative service. The guy who helped us was very friendly.
"Love the Fire, the picture is good and really like the amazon link"
"I have an LG tablet but picked up this one for my Dad and after messing with it for a while it's very nice,. I think I like it more the my LG g pad!"
This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be.
Better then the older models bigger and better then before
I really enjoy my amazon. It is getting easyer to use and I am finding new apps every day.
"This tablet is awesome...HD resolution, fast processor and affordable! Highly Recommended."
Nice tablet. Very speedy. The only thing I don't like is that I can't add GooglePlay apps to it. At only $69.00 I guess that's to be expected.
I use my kindle on a daily basis. It is a good size for reading in bed.
"The kindle was great but too small for my vision impaired mother, it was a gift,"
"My son totally loves it! The size is just right, and it is pretty fast. I don't have any complaints about it."
"On Christmas Eve I went in looking for an iPad as a gift. They were sold out and I was directed to the Amazon Fire HD8. The picture quality is amazing (hence the HD). I watched a movie on it and the picture was better than my HD tv. I have to say, I would buy this tablet over an iPad any day...AND it cost less than a fourth of the price!"
Decent tablet for the price. My kids love them!!!!
I am extremely pleased. Fast. Efficient. Reliable.
Purchased to watch movies. Quality is great. Sound from tablet needs work but earphone is usually used or at least recommended for personal use.
My son loves his kindle fire. He uses it every day.
"The Amazon Fire HD8 tablet is a high quality, inexpensive piece of technology that works great for anyone looking to purchase one that won't break the bank."
"Once taking time to install google play store, It functioned as good as any other android tablet. The down side is camera which doesn't produce clear pictures."
Bought for someone not tech savvy and he's done great
Bought this tablet on sale. I can look up all the things I 'm interested in.
This is a great product second one i purchase recomend it.
"The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great."
"This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the ""Amazon Android"" platform, but overall it's a great little tablet!"
It's great for my 7 year old. Easy for her to use.
"Wasn't happy with first one I opened as Christmas gift, it didn't work from right out of the box. Contacted Amazon and they sent a new one the next day. This one has worked from the get go. I'm now enjoying my new tablet. Very happy with Amazons service and prompt response to the issue."
"This is good for kids. Cheap enough that if they destroy it, you won't get upset"
Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants
Love Alexa and all of its features. Love that I can listen to music and read ebooks
"Paid $60 for it on sale during holidays, couldn't ask for better product for the price"
Bought this for each of my grandchildren and they loved it. Very user friendly
Great value from Best Buy. Bought at Christmas sale.
great tablet well worth the price which was a deal on black friday
"Original Kindle Fire would finally no longer charge so bought this to replace. Not quite the quality of original (not as fast, resolution not as good) but can't complain for the price. Good choice for casual web surfing and reading."
Does the trick. This is a good tablet for the price.
I bought this for my 3yr old son and it's perfect for him! With a mixture of games (kid friendly) and read-along books makes it a perfect for the kids and of course there's so much more for adults as well.. great buy!
"Great tablet, especially for the price. I bought this to replace an old Fire 7 tablet, that I had the battery going down. It works nicely and I love the Kindle Freetime and the parental control settings."
"Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job."
I bought this for my niece and she really enjoyed it. She was able to watch Netflix on it and play games. She could surf the internet if she needed to. We went with the bigger GB since it wasn't much more.
Gave it as a door prize at office party. They love it.
This tablet is simple to set up and it's worth the price. It's perfect for beginners.
Great tablet for easy operation. Was a great upgrade for a family member.
My 2nd Fire. Great picture quality. Easy to use. Would recommend for all ages.
"I bought this to take on cruise to read and listen to music... less expensive than my tablet, so if I loose it not as big a loss... it does all I thought it would..easy to set up... to get the most from this tablet you should be an amazon prime member $100 a year, not required,but lots of benefits from it"
"OK its not an iPad, but it is a very good tablet for less than 100 dollars.My only complaint is that it don't have a true GPS chip and relies on your WiFi reported location for apps and therefore some apps cannot be loaded on this device that rely on a true GPS. But it is a great travel tablet and with an SD card you can download your Amazon or other content and watch offline. A great travel tablet!"
For the price you get alot of valueGreat for watching movies amazon shopping youtube
"I got a magenta color because I loved the beautiful purple-ish color shown on the picture. Instead I got a really bright pink-ish color which looks nothing like the color shown here. I went to the store hoping to replace it with a different color but was told that since I bought it on sale, I had to pay the $30 dollar price difference if I wanted to exchange. Unbelievable. The product is good but I never liked the Best buy customer service."
This product met all of our my needs and I would recommend it to others.
Would recommend for the right person that wants low cost tablet BUT...Ended up returning this item because it was heavy and too wide for my hand to hold. It was too big to hold in hand and too small to use like a larger tablet. Ended up just using my Lenovo Yoga 900 since it was more flexible and only about .5 lb heavier.
"I have the HD 7 and an HDX 7, and the 8 outperforms them both. If you are an Amazon fan of the eco system, this is a must. The screen is bright and crisp. The processor performs very well with the latest software update. I love it."
Bought to use for recent travel. Was able to download several movies and TV shows from Netflix. Seems to have decent storage. Video playback was fine.
Just purchased the Amazon Fire 16GB model and so far it has performed as expected. Only drawback is the screen which is somewhat reflective of any light source and needs constant cleaning for smudges from normal use.
"Easy to set up and use. Nice graphics and lots of apps to choose. I got this for my husband who is technology challenged and so far, he's using it without getting frustrated, which is huge!"
love the first now a new one. everything at your fingertips.
"purchased for a little guy, and i am very pleased with it!!"
Perfect gift for the office co-workers or close friends
"This is actually a pretty good little tablet. It is not the most powerful and it doesn't have the highest resolution screen. But for the price, you can't go wrong. It does what it is supposed to do and for the low price you won't feel much pain if you break it. A perfect first tablet for the kids or a nice secondary tablet that you can just toss in a bag or the car for road trips."
"Amazon Fire tablets are the best products in their price ranges, especially if they are on sale as they were at the last Black Friday event. Excellent purchase."
I bought this as a way to easily read while on the go. I'm disappointed as it's really too big too easily carry around. I've discovered it's not all that easy to use it for reading purposes
"This tablet is the best one we've ever bought. And, the least expensive! It satisfies all of our needs; email, Facebook, Candy Crush, YouTube, Bluetooth broadcasting to a remote speaker. We love it. No frustration whey using the keyboard or finger clicking on icons or commands!"
i was surprised buy how light and compact this was but still strong enough to do what i needed.
Great for reading. Ordering books and use as a tablet.
"For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying."
"For the price, you can't beat this tablet. It is fast and basic."
I had problems with my White page and was in the process of buying ad new Kindle I found this was a better unit for my use than tine White-page.
Perfect for the price. It is great to bring with you on the go. And like I said can't beat the price. The only con is it has a plastic back so be careful. The battery is great. I would absolutely recommend this product.
"This tablet is not a high-tech state-of-the-art Speed Demon, but on the other hand it is more than good enough for daily use. The two biggest benefits to me are that it now comes with Alexa built in, and, you can download Amazon movies to the device to watch offline, for example on an airplane. These two features alone make it worth the very reasonable price."
good value for the money ..............................................................................................................
Gave this to my wife for Christmas. Upgraded from the original Kindle. She thoroughly enjoys it.
Fire is a good tablet. Portable size . Have bought a couple for gifts as well
This tablet is really easy to use and since I'm a Amazon Prime member the video's and music is easy to access. I'm really surprised how fast the unit compared to my older i-pad. I would recommend this if anyone wants a good value product.
This is a great tablet for the money. Perfect for someone who does not want to shell out hundreds for an iPad.
"like a tablet. great, fast connection. everything I wanted in an electronic reader."
No problems with the fire. Works well. Just need a case for it now. Size is very convenient.
"I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She said it is really easy to use and loves the lighting, it's easy for her to read."
Very helpful and friendly. Didn't have too much selection on what I was looking for. But found what I needed.
"This tablet is so great for the price, but Amazon has always put out excellent product. This is fairly lightweight and pretty fast too. Like all Amazon product it ties all your Amazon accounts so downloads and purchases are super easy. I have dropped it a couple of times and no damage... so it's pretty tough too."
It is a great and affordable tablet for my 12 & 13 year old grandsons. It keeps up with the higher speed internet.
So far the tablet works great. I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she downloads games no problem. The 16gb is great I'm glad I purchased the larger storage capacity.
"very good for kids to use, play games and watch kids videos."
I like that it gets 12 hours of charge time. Easy to use.
i bought this on a whim because my brother recommended i try it sometimes. hard to believe how important this is in my life. this has opened up my long forgotten youth with music and videos anytime
Was looking for a cheap tablet for my a son to use saw this unit on sale on black Friday good unit.
Basic internet plus a ton of Amazon apps and some standard ones too. If you want to use Amazon it is an excellent tool.
Easy setup. Confusing screens but practical and inexpensive.
Really enjoy this product. Love watching movies and playing games on my Fire HD 8
"Great rablet, clear screen and small design. Great for watching movies."
"Great for keeping around the house and doing basic Internet functions. For traveling it lets you bring books, movies and/or tv shows via Amazon so being Amazon Prime is a plus.For you business travelers, out of the box it can open, view, & edit MS Office files, .docx, .xlsx, & .pptx.All this for 25% the price of a iPad. Yes, the iPad can do more, but do you need it?"
I pulled the trigger on the fire tablet knowing the I would have to install the google play store separately. with some work this could be the most bang for your buck for an android tablet.
Purchased for my niece for a Christmas gift. She loves it no complaints
Best tablet money can buy for under 100$. Very happy with its performance and responsiveness. External speaker is much better on this than my more expensive samsung tab E tablet.
I use it at home instead of a computer. I gave it four stars instead of five because it seems to lose wifi frequently. However this could be due to house wifi issues. The tablet is fast and easy to use. Love the ease of downloading books.
Got this tablet on sale for $59.99 at Best Buy and got Webroot Internet Security free with purchase. This is not a high end tablet but it works really great for many of the things I do. For the price it can't be beat!
Easy to use and portable. Took on vacation and it was great to kkep up on emails and news.
"Really handy. Can check email, read a book. Also can access info on the web. Lightweight."
"I was hesitant to buy a Fire tablet but I just needed an extra around the house tablet and I was very impressed. If you need a tablet just to browse the internet, watch movies and light basic searches its perfect."
Purchased the device for my son to take full benefits of his prime account. A decent device with reasonable features for the low cost.
Bought this for my 5 year old son. He navigates through apps and sites easily. The built in Wifi is helpful for car rides. Parental controls blocks him from buying every download he finds attractive. We're still trying to figure out how to get Alexa to audio respond.
This product is very easy to set up and use. Has lots of great features that make it fun and easy for kids to play games and read books.
Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. She is an avid reader. She previously had a B&N Nook which stopped working. This is much nicer and she loves it. Would recommend for someone who likes to read while traveling or simply at home.
"Bought this tablet for a child at Christmas. After days of research, this tablet seemed to be the best buy of the lot. It had a good processor, decent memory, and good reviews. It should be exactly what a 12 year old would need in a tablet at a great price."
"I was looking for and cost effective solution to satisfy my childrens desires to have there own SmartPhone to play Games.I like the Parental controls, to limit certain actions and downloads."
"Great easy tablet for a reasonable price. Not the most super powerful. It can get the job done for simple tasks such as surfing the web, checking email, playing YouTube, etc. screen is clear and responsive. Great inexpensive tablet"
It was a gift for my granddaughter and she seems very happy with it so far.
"Purchase for a 12 year old. Sturdy, easy to usr. Great price"
I gave this as a gift for Christmas and still can't get it set up will have to go to geek squad to help
This tablet is great and easy to use. Great way to keep the kids entertain.
"It replaces my 6"" Fire Kindle. Love the HD quality."
Owned a kindle fire HDX for GameCircle years. Finally decided Goodreads upgrade. This fire HD 8 is great. Really Prime the larger screen and new features.
Amazon tablet that links to my amazon prime account so that i can watch all my movies and listen to my music.
Grandson used a borrowed one at school. So now has his own .
Great tablet for children and for entertainment...
This is a great tablet for the price it is offered at. Great for amazon prime members.
"my third amazon fire, has more features than my old one. battery lastlonger"
"Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price."
Nice size. Good processor speed. Not happy that I cannot gety Google music.
I think that my Amazon tablet does all that I need for it to do.Handy to have when traveling.Easy to operate.
While this tablet doesn't have the screen resolution that I'm used to it's a nice beginner tablet. Faster than my old Fire HD tablet I purchased years ago...
Great value. Daughter loves it. Easy to use and navigate for her.
"I bought the 8"" version on impulse because of an excellent offer on Black Friday. As an Amazon product, it offers Amazon apps. While you can get Google Play apps, it requires some hoops. I just discovered I can't save movies from Netflix because that only applies to the HDX version. So this product has limits. But used as a Kindle reader, or to get email via wifi, or other uses (wifi only) while traveling where you wouldn't want to take an expensive device, it is a good choice."
This is such a wonderful value for the money!!Clear display with great color!!
Tablet is wonderful for young kids. There's ways to switch it to kid friendly
This was a Christmas present so it hasn't had a lot of use yet but so far this tablet has worked well and was straightforward to set up
"We bought one of these for our 2 year old a few months ago and we liked it so much we bought one as a Christmas present for a 65 year old parent. It obviously isn't the highest quality tablet on the market, but it very responsive and gets the job done. And, you can't beat the price; just a great value."
I have two other versions of Kindle tablets and each one gets better. Great screen display allowing for clear and enjoyable viewing. Easy to use. Quick downloading and updating.
Perfect size. Works great. Just as advertised. Has a long battery life.
Easy tablet to use. Great camera.Touch screen. Very clear screen.
I still have my own Kindle since a few years ago and it still works. I love it and my grandkids both love their kindles.
"this is my 2nd hd 8, very fast and easy, great value"
Was looking for tablet to read books and this is perfect for that.
Turns out the Fire is much better than I expected. Well worth the $50 I paid for it!
Gave this as a gift and she was very pleased. Great product at a great price!
I am bring it back for an exchange. (a different make)
Beautiful picture. Enjoying different apps and looking forward to hours of fun.
Works well. Easy to use. I like the auto on when you open the case
"I bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He can use it to access the web. This item is great for kids, it is education. You canaccess over 13,000 books on amazon. It has helped my son with his reading."
I brought this tablet during the Black Friday sale fast forward to Christmas when my 6 year opens it he was happy I set it up for him two days later it crashed never came back on. Blank screen. He was disappointed and so was I .
"Mom loves the tablet. Easy for her to use, she uses it for Facebook, reading, and some of her games."
This was a gift from my wife. I wanted a lighter Kindle and this is it. I have been happy with this new version.
"Great quality, great price and best of all has good sound."
"This tablet is great, and it has a good battery life. I'd recommend for people who love to read."
"good value for the money, love the kindle for reading"
"Truly enjoying this fire. My last kindle fire is only 3 years old and works great but want a front and rear camera. Camera takes good pictures. Also like feature of ""Alexia""."
got this for wife for christmas she loves thing she can read her kindle book and surf the web like a regular tablet
Great e-reader. Easy to download books. Screen is easy to read from.
purchased for my mom and showed her a few apps and she took to it without further direction
"Nice tablet for the price. Being amazon prime member, I am using many amazon services and devices, tablet is really handy for managing it all very easily apart from other basic functinality of tablets."
"Had a Fire 7 previously which was ok but this one is brighter, faster and the larger keyboard makes a huge difference."
Bought this tablet for my mom who struggles with technology. The Fire HD8 was easy to setup and has many great features. She is catching on well and learning new applications daily. A great value.
"I've never had a tablet, I-phone, Smartphone . . . Nothing but PCs. This is my first foray into these modern electronics. I must say that, while I still find it very nerve-wracking, this Amazon Fire Tablet has been pretty user-friendly for an old man like me. I'm learning something new about it every day."
"Got it for my grandma. She loves it , has no complaints about it."
"For the price you can't beat this tablet for kids. I'm not a fan of Amazon's super restricted App Store, but the device itself is very good. I love the curfew feature. You can set up times that a child can or can't access the tablet without your permission."
This is so much easier to travel with than the lap top.
"Gave to my Grandchildren for Christmas, would like to get another for the same price for another Grandchild."
I took a couple of pictures with the camera and when I went to view them I can't seem to find the pictures. When I bought my tablet they transferred what I had on my 7in but some of the apps didn't transfer. I'll have to come in and have it explained.Other than that I am very pleased with it.
Bought this for my gf since she is on her phone playing games etc. I've used it a few times and like it.
Got this for my 11 yr old and my main concern was parental controls. Parental controls are an awesome feature and were easy to set up. Amazon had plenty of free apps for kids that i didnt need to purchase extra. Thank you I'm very happy with this purchase!
We purchased these because we really liked the price. We also bought protective cases for both and an antivirus program for them.
"Bought this for my mom for Christmas. It is her first tablet. She loved it, and will have no problems learning to use it. Very straightforward and easy to pick up. Great storage, fantastic resolution and really good features."
i really like this tablet..easy to use and looks great.
"Great tablet for the price, I would definitely recommend the higher gigabyte as it downloads quickly and doesn't take time to upload."
"It has great picture quality, all the applications seem to load very fast."
The device is a good item and I really recommend to everyone
"This Kindle was purchased on the black friday sale. At the time I felt it was a steal at that price. The first tablet I purchased a few years ago was the original Kindle Fire, the following year I purchased an iPad mini and now have the iPad mini 4. As you may already know, the iPad does not have explandable memory. This Kindle can have expanded memory to 200GB so that was a good selling point for me. After setting this new Kindle Fire up, I noticed that viewing photos were not as clear as the original iPad mini even without retina display, and the color had a greenish-yellowish tint to it. Some may not notice this if they do not have something else to compare it to. I'm a pro photographer so this was quite unaceptable to me. I was not expecting perfection with the colors but people's skin tones appeared greenish as if they were Vulcans. I also like to read tech manuals and magazines of which many are in PDF format. The Kindle will read this format but the Kindle Fire after all these years still cannot display the cover art from pdf books, etc.; it displays an acrobat pdf document logo instead. If you have a large library of pdfs you have to read through the document titles instead of being able to select by seeing the cover of the book. That was enough for me, I've been spoiled by the ease of use of the iPad and the display with accurate colors. Back to the store for a prompt refund it went. Overall..still a good deal but if you are used to an iPad for the reasons I am..you may be disappointed."
"Works well. But does not offer access to the apple or android App Store. Without the apps that I need, this tablet is not as useful."
this Amazon fire tab works really well.the syncing aspect is very nice being able to pair it with all my devices.i wish it had Google play.
It's a really good gadget ...I love everything about it...
I would definitely recommend it to others since it is a good value for money product.
Nice easy-to-use tablet. We just got it and so far so good
Easy to use and please send me a $50 gift certificate for filling out this survey or cash works too.
I bought this for my son. He been reading books and searching stuff on line and watching youtube on it. He said it didn't hurt his eyes like the iPad.
"great product I would recommend this tablet, grest price"
This tablet is by far one of the best purchases we've made for my son. The kids feature is extra nice!
"While the Fire hd8 tablet certainly will not perform like some of the more expensive units, for basic web surfing, email, and especially shopping on Amazons web site, this tablet performs well, although it will occasionally freeze while surfing some sites. The screen resolution is what I would call 'adequate', but not on par with other high resolution (and far more expensive) tablets out there.Overall, I am pleased with this tablet-so far."
Purchased this Kindle Fire HD8 from Best Buy. My fiancé downloaded her first book. She already started reading and said it is really cool to use. She said it is easy to see and navigate.
I have enjoyed using the Fire HD. It is fast and easy to use. I also appreciate all the things it will do.
The kindle fire hd is a sweet tablet for reading and apps like netflix or hulu.
It does everything my kids need without having to pay a ridiculous price.
The kindle is great not only is it a reader its bascially a computer. It connects to the internet it takes pictures and has many other great features.
"very satisfied with tablet, very fast and efficient"
I really enjoy using this tablet it runs very well
"Tons of value, if you want a budget tablet look no further."
"We purchased this tablet for our son for Christmas, to replace a malfunctioning Kindle Fire 7. We like Kindle for our kids for the parental controls. So far, this Kindle has performed fine. He seems happy with it."
Really crisp picture. Fast and good amout of storage.
I got the kindle fire hd8 for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it very much
The product is quite durable and user friendly in many aspects.
"This is our 4th kindle and we love them as ""beginner"" tablets for kids! No worries of data overages and with the sd card slot memory will no longer be an issue!"
My 10 year old has enjoyed playing on this. Great selection of apps and games.
did not expect this kind of quality for the price I paid. very surprised. nice product.
First off I can't get over how much I like this one. The battery life is great the screen is nice and clear .... and bright. I would buy it again if anything ever happened to it.
great compact tablet with great coclors and resolution-----decent battery life and good wi fi connectivity
I love this tablet! It's the perfect size. I can do everything on it and it was affordable!
"Can't beat for price,feels expensive but isn't. Does all the basics"
I love this tablet. The screen is so clear. So easy to read a book on.
I'm loving my kindle fire. It does everything I need it to do and more.
Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.
"The 8"" version is much better than the older 7"" version. Better graphics and faster processor"
"Better then a E-book, more options and versatility"
I haven't used a product like this and man I have to tell u it's better than apple products
This was exactly as advertised and did everything that was claimed. Setup was fast and easy and I have no complaints.
"Love this tablet for streaming, facebook, games and general web surfing. The apps are available on the amazon underground, not google playstore, so some apps that you may be used to using, may not be available on amazon underground. Overall, great tablet for the price. Would recommend."
"The screen is vibrant and clear. It is fast and doesn't lag when going onto different sites. If you have Amazon Prime this is the tablet for you as it gives you access to unlimited, music, movies, and tv. Awesome purchase!"
Great size and storage for reading my online books
Great price on a good tablet... especially on Black Friday
The HD8 is a Great tablet. I purchased two for my daughter's. The tablet feels durable to touch. The screen picture is crisp and clear.
My grandson loved it. I had the smaller one but wanted to larger one for him.
I received this as a gift. One of the best I've ever received.
"I bought two of these Fire Tablets for gifts for my sons. They are both thrilled with the features. They use them for gaming, music, photo albums, emails and online activities. The HD is what sold me. I have a Kindle Fire 2nd generation and I enjoyed mine so much since 2012, I looked into getting this one."
I gave my husband this tablet for Christmas. He is very pleased with the product. He likes it much better than the last tablet that I purchased him 3 years ago. He highly recommends the product.
Purchased due to reviews and in sale. So far easy to use.
"The Fire HD tablet is a good product. The screen has good viewing angles and the display is on point. However, the major issue I have are you have to be online to make any setting changes to the tablet.; and the advertisements that show up on the home screen is a downer. So, the rating of a 4 star is pushing for me."
It's such a great tablet !!! Love the picture and everything about it is amazing. I'm glad I chose this one and what a great deal I got on Black Friday
Bought for a 6 years old she loves it and is always on it great starter tablet
My 6 year old got it for Christmas and is able to use it very well
Gift for daughter. She loves it. Just opened so as far as I know it will be a great purchase.
Great product as usually ... better screen and faster than my previous. Work with my chromecast .. easy to use
This my second kindle .. it's light and faster than my previous kindle ..came with free audio books for 30 days which is cool ... better screen .. it does seem to be long than wider .. which I'm ok with and I got this on sale for 60 .. great deal
I used to watch youtube on my phone and wife decided I needed something bigger. I seem to like it very much. I did buy a micro sd card for it.
I previously had a nook that died and tried the Fire and I was hooked. Great price and lots of things to do
PICKED THIS TABLET UP ON BLACK FRIDAY. WHAT A GREAT DEAL. WORKS AWESOME AND HAS ALL OF THE AMAZON APPS.
"Second one, bigger, better, easy as pie to set up."
I bought this orange Fire Hd8 on Black Friday so it was at a great price. My husband likes it a lot. It was purchased as a replacement for his previous Fire 7 tablet that was having charging issues. I've heard of a several others having the similar issues so hopefully this model lasts longer and has an improved charging port.
Bought it for my dad who loves tech that his life easier the alexa integration is fantastic.
Purchased this as a gift for my father and he's loving it.
bought two for the family and they connect easily and work surprisingly fast for a small price.
I use my fire hd8 to download books from the library. Easier to read than on my smartphone.
We bought this to replace my children's aging Ipads and they're very happy.
I was looking for a easy to use tablet for a beginner and this met my needs .
"Bought this during black Friday sale offer, was a good purchase and cheap."
The Kindle Fire HD is an impressive Product. It is faster than my Samsung tablet. I know I will enjoy using it. I just wish that Amazon Prime music had a downloadable app for it.
"It is great , I like it very much. I can find anything you want."
Enjoy the pad and its options. Its a great starter pad for kids.
"Downloading is a breeze, works quick and effective for what I bought it for. Very pleased."
if you had a kindle fire 1st. this one is mush better.with all the new stuff inside .
"I bought two of these for the grandkids, I was going to show them how to set them up, didn't need to!"
"ilovemy kindle 8"" . However it has crash a couple of times and am not sure why. also the 8"" case is not made for this kindle because the clamps used to hold it are right on the buttons to turn on and volume. so if you have a better case for it please let me know."
Works very well. Cheaper than an iPad and works great for apps and video.
This was so easy to set up and the print can easily be adjusted to extra large. My 78 year old dad was really happy with his first experience with technology. He is now surfing the net and reading news online. Highly recommended.
horrible...just like the other 7 i have owned ONLY due to warranties
I got 2 of these for my 8 and 9 year old daughters and I love them and so do they
LOVE BEING ABLE TO MAKE SPECIFIC PROFILES FOR MY CHILDREN
We love the kindle fire HD8. it can have various profiles to accomodate all people who uses it in our family household. it is also very easy to set up
"Bought this Kindle because of the great price. Good thing, because I dropped the other one without the case on it and it cracked."
"I purchased this as alight weight replacement for my laptop. It has accomplished everything I needed. I'm sure there will be something's I still need HP for, but this is a great tablet for what I needed. I got a case and 64gig card also. Everything works seamlessly so far."
"I upgraded my mother's 3rd generation Amazon Kindle Fire HD 7"" to this new one and she likes the display being bigger to 8"" and is much faster."
"My husband bought this on Black Friday at a really great price! He loves how lightweight this is, and offers him his email, internet functionality and books, of course. Great buy!"
"This fire is much better than the old one so far. It responds much faster and has a much better screen. I also put a 128 gig memory stick into it which the old fire could not accommodate. So far, so good."
This was purchased an a reward for a job well done. Set up was easy and the functionality was perfect for my needs.
I found this to be a great tablet for all ages-easy to use-great content.
You cannot get a better tablet for the price and Best Buy had it on sale.
Daughter loves it. Everything transferred from her Kindle to the fire. She said it is unbelievable fast.
This version is a really good upgrade over the older fire tablet that we had before. Very happy with it.

"I purchased this item for my son as a Christmas gift. His eyes lit up as he unwrapped it on Christmas morning. Later in the day, his older cousin had to call me and verify if he had truely received this item as a Christmas gift... I also plan on taking Best Buy up on their e - mailed offer that I received, which states that I can receive free start up service to get me started with my tech purchase."
